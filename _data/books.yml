      title: "Introduction"
      content: |
        One bright spring morning, in the little town of Spring Breeze, Dreamland, seven puppies were born to Springtime and Showerstorm. Springtime, her emerald-colored eyes shining as brightly as the morning sun, cleaned them well, nudging them gently with her nose as they uttered tiny whimpering noises and pushed each other aside to be the first to nurse from her. 
        Showerstorm, the proud father, beamed at his lovely children and his beautiful wife. “Well, dear, you did it!” he declared. “Seven puppies!”
        Springtime nodded, smiling. “Five boys and two girls,” she confirmed. “What should we name them?”
        Showerstorm knit his brow. “Ah. . .well, I assumed you had already thought of names before they were born,” he confessed.
        Springtime bit her lip and shook her head. “No. I guess I was so excited at the thought of having puppies that I forgot to think of names for them until now.”
        “Then we’ll brainstorm and use our lively imaginations to come up with really creative and unusual names for them!” retorted Showerstorm, tossing his head, his brown eyes filled with determination. Springtime had to smile at the look on his face.
        “Okay,” she said agreeably. “I think the oldest should be. . .” She glanced down at the eldest child, a boy, as he fought his sisters and brothers to get milk. He seemed so fiery and snippy, she thought. He liked to push the others around.
        And then the perfect name came to mind. “His name shall be Sniper,” Springtime blurted out.
        Showerstorm gazed down at Sniper for a minute, then burst into peals of laughter. “That’s the right name for him!” he chuckled. “What about the other boys?”
        It took a few minutes to think of names for Sniper’s brothers, but in the end, Springtime managed to name them all. “The other boys—from the eldest to the youngest—will be named Sharkell, Yodi, Pancake, and Waffle.” She looked up at her husband. “Sound good?”
        “It’s fantastic,” he assured her. “Now for the girls.”
        The second-to-last puppy was a gray-and-white Siberian like Springtime’s sister, Summer. There was some debate about her. Springtime wanted to name her after Summer’s favorite flower, but Showerstorm wanted to name her after an object in space, such as a star or a galaxy. In the end, they decided to put both of their ideas together and named her Azalea-Star, but they agreed to call her Star for short.
        Springtime then turned her attention to the final puppy, a black-and-white Malamute like herself. This one wasn’t fighting to get milk like the others but was instead patiently waiting her turn. Springtime has to smile at how calm the child was, unlike the other high-strung puppies. “To be honest, I’m stuck on this little girl,” Springtime admitted. “I can’t think of a proper name for her.”
        “Oreo?” Showerstorm suggested.
        Springtime’s eyes widened. “No way!” she objected. “That’s a terrible name.”
        Showerstorm smothered a giggle. “Um, okay. How about Luna?”
        Springtime vigorously shook her head. “Not Luna, either. It has to be absolutely perfect.”
        “Why absolutely perfect?” Showerstorm asked.
        Spriingtime never answered, for she was distracted by her youngest daughter. The puppy rolled over onto her back and yawned, and as she rolled, Springtime caught sight of something dark on the bottom of the puppy’s left-front paw. She bent down and peered more closely at it. It was a diamond mark surrounded by a circlet of ten tiny stars all joined together. Springtime gasped upon seeing it.
        “What is it?” Showerstorm asked, and Springtime pointed to the mark with her paw. Showerstorm’s eyes opened wide.
        “Showerstorm!” Springtime exclaimed. “Do you see? Do you see? This is the one! The Star Warrior we’ve been waiting for!”
        “She’s the one who was prophesied to set Dreamland free from Nightmare’s grasp,” Showerstorm said wonderingly. “Photron, ancient ruler of the universe and the forger of the sacred sword, Galaxia, prophesied that a child born with this mark would be the sole rescuer of Dreamland!”
        “Amazing!”
        “Truly astounding, my dear!”
        “And now the prophecy has been fulfilled!”
        “Not quite,” Showerstorm reminded his wife. “The prophecy is only fulfilled when Nightmare dies.”
        “But how can you even kill Nightmare?” Springtime asked.
        Showerstorm cast a puzzled look at his wife. “What do you mean?”
        “Nightmare is what his name tells—he’s a living nightmare,” she explained. “Dreams are only what you see in your mind—mirages of the mind, I call them.” Her eyes clouded. “In truth, I don’t think you could ever get rid of him. That demon’s got a lot of tricks up his sleeve!”
        “Nothing our daughter can’t handle,” Showerstorm replied.
        “You’re acting like she’s invincible,” Springtime snapped.
        “I didn’t say that, but I’m not going to say I doubt her abilities, either. I believe she can take him down—with God’s help, that is.” He paused, then continued, “And as for Nightmare being killed, I’m sure he can be. But it would have to take a certain weapon.”
        “What weapon is that?” 
        “I’m not sure. Perhaps she’ll be the one to find out the answer. Then again, she may not. There are other Star Warriors out there. And remember, the prophecy did not explicitly state that she was going to be the one to kill Nightmare. It just said she would free Dreamland from his rule.”
        “But how can she free the citizens of Dreamland without first getting rid of him?”
        Showerstorm shook his head. “The prophecy doesn’t say how she’ll free Dreamland. Perhaps she might have a backup crew who will assist her in her mission, but she’ll be the main, uh, hero, if that makes sense.”
        Springtime nodded. “That actually makes sense. Yes, maybe that is how it will happen.”
        Showerstorm smiled. “But we got off track,” he gently reminded her. “We were trying to think of what to name our special little girl.”
        One word rolled of the tip of Springtime’s tongue: “Cloudburst.”
        Showerstorm froze. “Cloudburst?” he repeated.
        “Yes,” Springtime said. “A cloudburst is a sudden violent rainstorm,” she explained.
        “I know that,” replied Showerstorm. “But why name her after a rainstorm?”
        Springtime placed a paw around her daughter’s body and drew her close. “As a cloudburst is unexpected, so this little Star Warrior was unexpected.” She looked out the open parlor window at the blue sky dotted with only a few clouds. “And just as a rainstorm can cause dramatic effects on the earth, this girl will change the world in a big way.” 
        Showerstorm couldn’t forget the brightness in his wife’s eyes or the gentle smile she wore. Her happiness was contagious, and he caught it too. “If you desire to name her Cloudburst, then do so. I’m perfectly fine with it.”
        “But let’s call her Cloudy,” Springtime told him. He nodded in agreement and both laughed, though neither knew why.
        Cloudy yawned again and began to nurse from her mother. Springtime looked down at her little twin and nosed her, and she could have sworn that a smile flashed across Cloudy’s face. The wind blew gently around the house and the scent of the roses out front permeated the air with a sweet-smelling fragrance.

        SIX MONTHS LATER, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 19. . .

“Look out!” Cloudy cried.
Sniper, who was running a race with Yodi and Pancake, skidded to a stop to avoid slamming into his sister. “Cloudy, what are you doing standing in the middle of our racecourse?” Sniper demanded. “You’re in the way!”
“She’s always in the way,” Yodi said.
“That’s because she’s a girl,” Sniper sneered, a look of triumph in his eyes. 
Cloudy drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly, counting to ten. She didn’t want to say something rude. “Mommy told me to tell you that it’s time for dinner, so come inside now,” she said.
Sniper shrugged, then turned to Pancake and Yodi. “Sorry, guys, we’ll have to forfeit the race for now. We gotta eat.”
Cloudy slowly followed Sniper and her other brothers inside, pausing only to smell the roses. Springtime was in the kitchen and setting the table when they walked in. “Hello, children,” she said sweetly.  “Go wash up. Supper will be ready in a few minutes.”
Cloudy joined her other siblings as they crowded into the bathroom, struggling to be the first to get to the sink. Cloudy stood a little ways off from the arguing and shouting puppies, staring uncomfortably at the floor. She didn’t like hearing anyone yell at or fight or make fun of one another. She knew to follow the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” Jesus Himself had said this in the Bible, and Cloudy determined to live for the Lord and follow Him no matter what.
“What is happening in here?!” Springtime cried, darting into the bathroom and trying to separate the wrestling children. “Stop this! Stop right this minute!”
At last, she managed to quiet the puppies down. Frowning disapprovingly at them, she said in a sharp tone, “I don’t want to hear you all yelling at each other again. You need to get along. Don’t forget, God put you in the same family. You have to love, show kindness, and extend grace to one another when you mess up. Understand?”
“Yes, ma’am,” they all answered respectfully in one voice. Sniper tossed his head.
“Good. Now wash up and be respectful,” said Springtime, exiting the bathroom. The puppies obeyed, lining up carefully.
Sniper smirked at Cloudy as he passed by her to exit the bathroom. “Too bad you’re the youngest, Cloudy,” he laughed. “If you were the oldest, you’d get the special privileges that all the firstborn children do.” He stood tall and bragged, “Mommy like me the best ‘cause I’m the eldest.”
“Who cares?” Cloudy scoffed. “If firstborns act as mean as you do, then I’m perfectly content not to be one.”
Sniper uttered a low growl in his throat. “Excuse me? I’m the oldest child here. You have to obey me!”
“Oh, brother! You’re not my boss! You can’t order me around!” Cloudy retorted.
“Can you two please shut up now?” Star sighed, turning to fix them with her bothered gaze, her dark blue eyes communicating annoyance. “Honestly, your bickering gets sort of bothersome sometimes.”
“We’re not bickering—” Cloudy started to say, but Sniper cut her off.
“You’re one to talk. You who were arguing not ten minutes ago!” snapped Sniper, glaring at Star.
Star rolled her eyes, thoroughly fed up with Sniper’s attitude. “Well, unlike you, Mr. I-Love-Being-A-Brat, I am not rude and nasty to everyone like you are!”
“Wanna rephrase that?” Sniper snarled.
“No.”
Cloudy shook her head. Why couldn’t her siblings just stop going at each other!

                                                 *   *   *   *   *

Nearly twenty minutes later, the puppies and their parents were seated around the table, devouring fruit salad, yams, yogurt, and lemon crème pie. Cloudy complimented her mother on her excellent cooking skills.
Springtime flushed. “I try my best,” was her humble reply.
Showerstorm laid down his fork and asked Cloudy, “So, Cloudy, how was school for you kids today? Learn anything new?”
Cloudy shrugged. “I learned how to solve one-digit division problems in math and we learned how energy works in science. But otherwise, I didn’t really learn anything very new.” Her voice was toneless. 
Springtime flashed a worried look at her daughter. “Dear, are you okay? You’re not doing badly in school, are you?”
“Of course she’s not,” Star broke in. “Out of the whole class, her grades are the highest.”
“Really, Star,” Cloudy said firmly. “We don’t need to brag, okay? It’s not that big of a deal.”
“I’d say it is,” Springtime answered. “If you’re doing the best out of everyone, then I’d say you’re well on your way to a good future in education.”
Sniper took a sip of water. “Well, actually, she just cheats.”
“What!” Showerstorm blurted out.
“Will you shut it? I do not,” Cloudy said. “If anything, that sounds like something you would do.”
Sniper was briefly nonplussed, but blinked and said stoutly, “Well, you know I don’t cheat, either.”
“Okay, children, let’s not start something stupid, okay?” Springtime said. “We want to be on our best behavior, don’t we?”
Showerstorm sounded displeased when he said, “I hope you children don’t behave this way in school.”
“Oh, we don’t,” Sniper said. “However, there’s a certain girl who loves to pester the life out of Clo—”
Before Sniper could finish his sentence, Cloudy kicekd him under the table.
“Ow!” Sniper exclaimed. “Who kicked me?”
“Will you be quiet?” Cloudy hissed in his ear. “Don’t tell them that!”
“Fine, fine,” Sniper grumbled, taking another sip of his water.
“I’m sorry,” Springtime said, surprised at Cloudy’s reaction. “What were you saying, Sniper?”
Sniper glanced at Cloudy, but her expression was stern as she shook her head ever so slightly. “Uhh. . .I was just saying that there’s a certain girl at school who loves, uh, when it’s cloudy outside.”
“What does that have to do with pestering?” Showerstorm asked, sounding extremely confused.
“Oh, ah, you see, um. . .” He looked to Star for help, but she just shrugged. “Uh, she-she loves it when her brother pesters her on cloudy days.” He grinned weakly. “It’s a bit weird, but you know. . .” 
Springtime and Showerstorm looked at each other, their expressions saying plain as day, “That made no sense whatsoever.”
“O-kay. That sounds unique,” Springtime said. “Very unique.” She cleared her throat. “Okay. You children had better get to bed now. You have a busy school day tomorrow and you wouldn’t want to sleep through the lessons, would you?”

                                                    *   *   *   *   *

The next morning, Cloudy packed her schoolbooks and lunchbox in her black backpack scattered with red roses. She slipped the backpack over her shoulders, then wrapped a red scarf around her neck. The November days were very chilly now, and the nights were even colder.
“Are you kids ready yet?” shouted Springtime as she fussed with Cloudy’s bow. “Hurry up! You’re going to be late!”
“I can’t find my backpack, Mommy! Sniper hid it!” Yodi hollered.
“No, I didn’t,” Sniper called. “It’s in your bedroom, you idiot!”
“I already checked there twice and I couldn’t find it! I left it by the window yesterday, but it’s not there anymore! You did hide it! I know you did!”
“No! He’s lying, Mommy!”
“I am not! You’re the liar!”
“I did not take your backpack! Don’t blame me because you misplaced it! You need to keep up with your own junk!”
“You took it and you’re lying about it!” Yodi screamed. “Give it back right now!”
Springtime felt like she was going to explode at these kids if they did not shut their mouths and hurry up and get to school. They were driving her nuts, especially Sniper and Yodi!
“Yodi,” Star said, appearing at the foot of the stairs and holding up a brown backpack. “Is this yours?”
Yodi stared at the backpack for a second. “Why, yes!” he exclaimed in astonishment. “But where did you find it?”
“You dropped it by the front door yesterday when you came home from school and forgot to take it up to your room,” replied Star.
Yodi blushed. “Oh.”
Cloudy rolled her eyes.
“Aha!” Sniper yelled at the top of his lungs. “I told you! I told you I didn’t take it! You liar!”
“Okay, I’m sorry!” Yodi cried. “But how was I supposed to believe you? You’ve taken and hidden my backpack many times before in the past!”
“Well, just because I’ve done it in the past doesn’t mean I did it now, does it?”
Yodi slowly shook his head. “Well, no.”
“There! You see? You assumed I was the big fat liar and in reality you’re the big fat liar!”
“Dude, I said I was sorry! Let it go!”
Sniper blew out his breath and stormed off back into his room in a huff. Yodi stepped carefully down the stairs, took the backpack from Star, and slipped it onto his back. “Thanks for finding my backpack, Star.”
“You’re welcome,” Star said. “But we have to get a move on before Mommy blows a gasket.”
The rest of the puppies skipped down the stairs and received a hug from Springtime, then rushed out the house and crossed the street to their school, Emmanuel Elementary, a Christian school. Cloudy always loved going to school, except for one thing. . .
“Uh-oh,” Star whispered, quickly shielding Cloudy with her body as they stepped into the cool hallway. “Don’t look now, but here comes Wylanda Coven and her crew.”
Cloudy peeked around Star and saw a brown-haired humanoid girl around ten years old standing with five or six other kids about the same age. Cloudy sighed. Wylanda was a spoiled brat who bothered younger kids and bragged about this mansion she lived in and all the pretty things she had and how her parents were so wealthy. Though Cloudy hadn’t told her parents, Wylanda always annoyed her and  played pranks on her. Once when Cloudy was drinking from the hallway fountain, Wylanda had dumped pencil shavings on her head. Another time she had put pepper in Cloudy’s backpack and Cloudy had sneezed continuously for two days straight without knowing why. Springtime worried she might be coming down with something until Cloudy figured out it was just pepper. But the most bothersome thing Wylanda did was gossip about Cloudy’s mother behind Cloudy’s back. Cloudy was not okay with that and wanted so much to get back at Wylanda, but she dared not.
Star put her mouth close to Cloudy’s ear. “Have you told Mommy and Daddy about Wylanda and how she’s been bugging you?”
Cloudy shook her head.
“Why not?” Star asked.
“It’s not bothering me,” Cloudy lied.
Star scoffed. “Not bothering you? Ha. Lies. I know perfectly well you’re annoyed by this. Why don’t you just tell them?”
“Why don’t you?” Cloudy shot back.
“Because it’s not my place to tell them. It’s yours,” Star said as if the answer were completely obvious.” Besides, me or your brothers telling Mommy and Daddy about your plight won’t teach you to speak up for yourself.”
Cloudy knew her sister was right, but refused to admit it.
“Well, lookie here!” Wylanda said loudly, advancing toward Cloudy. “Nice to see you again, Prophesied One.”
For a moment, just a moment, Cloudy wished she were not the Prophesied One. Then maybe she wouldn’t attract so much attention from the bullies. “Hi, Wylanda,” Cloudy said, forcing herself to speak politely.
“On your way to the kindergarten room?” Wylanda said condescendingly. “That’s cute. Wonder what you’ll be doing today. Maybe learning how to draw. Just don’t eat the crayons, okay? They’re not good for your digestion.” She laughed, and her in-crowd followed her example.
“Okay, that’s enough, Wylanda,” Star snapped. “My sister had more talent in one paw than you do in your entire body!”
“Oh, is that so? Well, I’m a whole lot smarter. After all, I’m in fourth grade.”
“I don’t care if you’re in ninth grade,” Sniper said rudely. “Being bigger than someone else gives you no right to be mean to little kids. Especially kindergartners. Girl, use your common sense!”
Cloudy thought that Sniper’s statement was rather ironic, considering he was mean to her just about every second of every day. Still, she knew he loved her too much to let anyone else bother her.
“She can’t,” Yodi said sadly. “She doesn’t have any.”
“Yeah,” Sharkell agreed. “She’s too dumb to have any common sense.”
“You boys need to grow up,” said Wylanda angrily. “How dare you say such rude things to a lady?”
“No, you need to grow up,” Star retorted. “How do you ever expect to make a life for yourself if you’re always mean? You’ll never be able to get a job, much less a husband, unless he acts just like you.”
“I’ll manage somehow,” Wylanda said calmly.
“Ugh,” Star groaned.
“Star, never mind,” Waffle said. “Let’s just get to our room. We don’t need to engage with her, you know.”
“Yeah. Okay,” Star said.
The puppies turned away and were about to walk off to their classroom when they heard Wylanda say, “You know, Cloudy, your mom’s so ugly I get repulsed when I see her.” She burst into laughter.
Cloudy stopped in her tracks and whirled sharply to face Wylanda, who was smirking at her. “What?” Cloudy said in a low tone. “What did you say about my mother?”
Wylanda grinned. “Your mother’s so ugly I get repulsed when I see her.”
“Don’t say that about Mommy!” Cloudy ordered. “She’s very beautiful, probably much more beautiful than yours!”
“You’re ugly too. Just like your mom.” Wylanda burst into laughter.
That was all Cloudy could take. She was furious. No one talked about her mother that way and got away with it! Without even stopping to consider the consequences, she leapt on Wylanda and knocked her to the floor, and Wylanda screamed and pushed Cloudy off her. Cloudy grabbed the hem of Wylanda’s dress in her teeth and tugged it so hard a piece of it tore.
Wylanda let out a loud shriek. “You moron!” she shouted. “That was my best school dress! It cost over a thousand dollars!”
“I don’t care how expensive it was!” Cloudy yelled. “No one calls my mother ugly!” She bit Wylanda’s dress sleeve and yanked at it with all her strength while Wylanda tried to shove her away. 
Star was almost hysterical. “Cloudy, no! Stop!” she cried in horror. “You’re gonna get in trouble!”
“It doesn’t matter!” Cloudy tore the dress sleeve off and dropped it onto the floor, then lunged at Wylanda again. Wylanda screamed loudly as Cloudy’s claws raked her arm, and she grabbed Cloudy by the scruff and slammed her down onto the hard linoleum.
“What in the world?!” the third-grade teacher cried out as she darted over to the two struggling girls and with great difficulty separated them. “Stop this right now! You girls ought to be ashamed of yourselves! Fighting in the hallway! What’s gotten into you?”
Wylanda coughed and wiped some blood off her dress. “I’m sorry, ma’am,” she said sweetly, “but Cloudy here was attacking me!”
The teacher looked shocked. “What?! Why?!”
“Well. I just—”
“She called my mother ugly!” Cloudy yelled.
“No, I didn’t,” Wylanda told the teacher. “She’s lying. What really happened is that I invited her to my house for the weekend, and she called me an idiot and said she wouldn’t come over even if I begged her to. So I just said okay and walked off without reacting, so she called my mom a moron and dared me to fight. I didn’t want to, and that was when she leaped on me and attacked me!”
The teacher frowned disapprovingly at Cloudy and shook her head in disgust. “I’m afraid you need to come with me to the principal’s office, Cloudy.”
“What?” Cloudy gasped. “But. . .But. . .”
“No buts. Come with me now.”
“Wait, ma’am!” Star called frantically. “It wasn’t Cloudy’s fault! It was Wylanda who—”
“I don’t want to hear it,” the teacher said sternly. “You guys need to get to class anyway.”
“But Cloudy didn’t—”
“I said I don’t want to hear it! Get to class!” the teacher commanded, and the puppies scurried away.
“Come with me,” the teacher firmly told Cloudy, and Cloudy followed, her tail drooping. 

                                                      *   *   *   *   *

Cloudy sat on a leather chair in front of Principal Millie Daze, who was eyeing Cloudy with a steady gaze. Cloudy couldn’t look at her. She felt so ashamed.
“I heard what happened from Mrs. Monsoon,” Principal Daze said shortly. “She said you attacked Wylanda Coven and tore her dress because she wouldn’t fight you.”
Cloudy said nothing, but kept her eyes trained on the floor. What was there to say? Even if she told the truth, she doubted anyone would believe her anyway.
Principal Daze straightened up in her chair. “Okay. So what really happened out there?”
Cloudy couldn’t believe her ears. Had she actually heard Mrs. Daze right? She raised her eyes to the principal’s face and saw that Mrs. Daze was smiling. Could it be? Did Mrs. Daze know Wylanda’s story was false?
“Wait a second,” Cloudy said, leaning forward in her chair. “Are you saying you don’t believe Wylanda?”
Principal Daze laughed. “You’re kidding, right? There’s no way I would ever believe anything that girl told me. She’s been coming here for three years and she’s lied to me several times before. No, I don’t believe her story. But I would like to hear yours.”
“Mine?” Cloudy was bewildered. “But why?”
“I believe you will tell me the complete truth,” Principal Daze explained. “I know your mother is raising you and your brothers and sister to be honest. Go ahead, Cloudy. I trust you.”
So cloudy told her everything—from Wylanda being mean to her ever since she started school in September to Wylanda calling her mother ugly. Principal Daze did not interrupt at all during the story. She merely sat with her chin in her hand and listened until Cloudy was finished.
“Okay, I see,” Mrs. Daze said. “Wylanda was being mean to you and insulted your mother and you got angry and attacked her, is that right?”
“Yes,” answered Cloudy. Then she hung her head. “But I suppose I shouldn’t have jumped on her, huh?”
“No, you shouldn’t have,” Principal Daze replied. “But I can understand if you did. Little kids tend to fly off the handle if something or someone gets on their nerves.” She rolled her eyes. “Believe me, I know. I have three kids all under the age of five. They can be a handful.”
Cloudy nodded. “So. . .am I in trouble?” she asked in a small voice.
Principal Daze shook her head. “After hearing both sides of the story and considering all the evidence, I’d say you had a right to attack her. Not that I’m condoning you acting so violent, but she had it coming. I will punish her and let you off the hook just this once. But,” she added sternly, leaning over her desk do that she was glaring Cloudy right in the eye, “I will say this. DO NOT ever attack anyone in this school again—or anywhere, for that matter—or you will end up in severe trouble. Do I make myself clear?”
“Yes, ma’am,” Cloudy said respectfully, sitting up straight.
“Good. Now get to class.”
“Yes, ma’am.” Cloudy jumped out of the chair and turned to leave, but then looked back. “Principal Daze. . .thank you.”
Mrs. Daze grinned. “You’re welcome. Now get going!”
Cloudy left the office and hurried to class. On the way, she grabbed her backpack on the floor where she had dropped it in her fight with Wylanda and dashed to her classroom just as Mrs. Ivy was starting math, their second subject of the day.
Cloudy entered the room and the door banged shut. The sound echoed throughout the room and caused every student to look her direction.
Mrs. Ivy blinked. “Cloudy, you’re late. Where were you?”
“With Principal Daze,” Cloudy answered, taking her seat beside a gray husky she had never seen before. She gazed at him curiously, and he briefly glanced at her and then returned his attention to his math book.
Upon seeing Cloudy looking at the newcomer, Mrs. Ivy chuckled and said, “That’s Arrow, Cloudy. He moved here just last week.”
Cloudy nodded, barely hearing Mrs. Ivy’s words. “Hi, Arrow,” she said, trying to be friendly.
“Hi, Cloudy,” Arrow replied, beaming her a warm smile. Cloudy felt her heart skip a beat as she turned to page 57 in her book. She wondered if she and Arrow were going to be the best of friends. . .maybe more.
After math and science came history, and this was where Cloudy learned about something very interesting that she had never heard of before. It was a holiday called Thanksgiving. Mrs, Ivy taught about how, when, and where the first Thanksgiving originated in Dreamland, and Cloudy listened with rapt fascination.
“Three hundred years ago,” Mrs. Ivy began, “a group called the Pilgrims set aboard a ship called the Moonflower to go to the New World. They left their hometown to seek religious freedom, or the freedom to worship God. Their time on the ship was very hard and unhealthy, but none of that mattered when they reached the New World. They built houses and farmed for their living. However, many died that first winter of disease and poor nutrition. But in the spring, and Indian named Sumosot came to help them, as well as another Indian named Squinto. Missisoit and his tribe helped them too, and the Pilgrims made a peace treaty with the Indians. And that fall, they all had a big feast and partied and praised God.”
Cloudy was amazed by the story, but she didn’t fully grasp what Thanksgiving was all about.

                                                      *   *   *   *   *

After school was dismissed at three o’clock that afternoon, Cloudy packed her books neatly in her backpack and left the school. The sun was shining and the sky was a bright blue, and a few rose petals from the school’s neatly trimmed rosebushes were at her feet. Cloudy bent down and sniffed one, sighing with delight at its smell. She had always loved roses. They were her favorite flower.
“Hey, Cloudy!” a voice called from behind her. Cloudy turned and smiled upon seeing Arrow. He looked even handsomer in the sunlight than he did in the classroom. His grayish-green eyes were bright with enthusiasm and his smile was contagious. Cloudy sighed dreamily. He was so handsome, he could be the ideal picture of any girl’s dream boy.
Wait, Cloudy thought to herself, frowning. Why do I feel this way toward Arrow? Am I in love? That’s way too weird. I’m too young to have a boyfriend. Why am I falling for him? I don’t even know him that well. I’ve absolutely got to stop myself before I start acting all mushy and lovey-dovey toward him.
“On your way home, Arrow?” Cloudy asked as he fell in step with her.
“Nah,” Arrow replied. “I just wanted to talk to you real quick.”
“Really?” Cloudy’s pulse quickened in anticipation. “About?”
“Well,” Arrow said slowly, scuffing his paw in the dirt, “I don’t have any friends here, so I was wondering if. . .well, if, if you would. . .if you would be my friend.” He smiled a little. “You’re a really nice girl.”
Cloudy beamed excitedly. “I’d love to be your friend, Arrow,” she said sweetly. A little embarrassed by her tone of voice, she quickly cleared her throat and asked nonchalantly, “So, Arrow, where did you originally come from?”
Arrow paused in midstep, looking as though he weren’t quite sure what she was asking. “Um, my mother?” he said uncertainly.
Cloudy laughed hysterically as Arrow looked uneasily at her. “You’re funny. But seriously, where are you from?”
Arrow gazed blankly at her. “I have no clue what you mean.”
“I mean, what location were you from before you moved here?” Cloudy asked, being more clear this time. She chided herself for her own thoughtlessness. That’s what you get when you have eyes only for a handsome boy, she thought.
“Oh! I was born and raised in Leupochena,” Arrow said. “It’s a tiny town off the northern coast of Spring Breeze.”
Leupochena? Cloudy thought. “My Auntie Summer and Uncle Soldier live there with my cousins.”
“Hey! My dad’s name is Soldier!” Arrow said, chucking a little. “But my mom is Ruby. I also have two sisters named Turquoise and Opal and an older brother named Button. I live in an apartment near Oromo Thuli Hospital.”
“I have five brothers named Sniper, Sharkell, Yodi, Pancake, and Waffle. Snuper is really annoying and rude. I also have a sister named Star. She can be a pain, but overall she’s nice. I live in that house across the street there. I love living there. I even have a balcony I can stand on and look out at the pasture. It’s amazing! And I like my school too! It’s the best ever! Mrs. Ivy is the nicest teacher in the whole world. Oh, by the way, did she tell you I’m the Prophesied One?”
Arrow grinned widely and held up a paw to stop Cloudy’s seemingly endless chatter. “No, she didn’t tell me. But I’m glad I met you, Prophesied One. You must be famous!”
“I don’t get much recognition at my age,” Cloudy confessed. Then a scowl darkened her face. “Actually, no, I take that back. Wylanda Coven, the school bully, seems to enjoy bugging me because I’m the prophesied Star Warrior. Why, just today she called my mom ugly and I attacked her!”
Arrow’s eyes widened. “Whoa! You attacked her? That’s going a bit too far, don’t you think? I mean, you could’ve walked away and not engaged with her.”
“I realize that now, and Principal Daze understood my actions,” Cloudy said. “But she warned me never to attack anyone again or I’m busted.”
“Ooh, that’s scary. Better not attack anyone, then.”
“I won’t.”
For the next fifteen minutes, the two spoke to one another and got to learn much about each other. Both had been born in March that year and were nearly the same age, Arrow being a few days older. Both were Christians and wanted to be missionaries when they grew up, but Arrow wanted to be a preacher instead of a traveling missionary like Cloudy.
At a quarter to four, Cloudy looked up at the clock on the front of the school and gasped. “Oh, goodness!” she exclaimed, leaping to her feet. “I should have been home the minute school was dismissed! Gotta go!”
“Pray that your mother forgives you,” Arrow teased, his eyes dancing.
“Very funny,” Cloudy said. “See you!”
“See you tomorrow!” Arrow shouted after her as she darted away.

      title: "The Meaning of Thanksgiving"
      content: |
        Cloudy quickly hurried into her house and slammed the front door shut, dropping her backpack by the umbrella stand as she did so. “Mommy!” she shouted. “Mommy, I’m home!”
Springtime glided from the kitchen and gave her daughter a welcoming hug. “Hello, dear. Where were you? All your siblings got home way before you.”
Cloudy shifted her weight from foot to foot, suddenly nervous. If all my siblings got home before me, then that must mean one of them must have told about the fight with Wylanda. And that means I’m gonna be in for the biggest beating of my life. But how can I possibly explain why I did what I did? “Um, it’s a long story. But to put it bluntly, I met this new student named Arrow.”
Springtime eyes her daughter with a kind smile. “How nice! And did you make friends with him?”
Cloudy furrowed her brow in puzzlement, wondering why her mother wasn’t mentioning the fight with Wylanda. “I did,” Cloudy said, dropping her eyes to the green linoleum, “but I have to confess that I sort of like him.”
Springtime raised an eyebrow. “Ohh. You mean ‘like’ as in you’re in love with him?”
“Ye-ah,” Cloudy said, not sure whether to be embarrassed or flattered. “Now don’t assume he’s my boyfriend or anything,” she quickly added, “because he’s not. We’re just really good friends. I learned he’s a Christian and that he’s practically the same age as me.”
“Wow,” Springtime murmured, straightening Cloudy’s off-kilter bow. “He sounds like a really kind boy.”
“Oh, he is! He is!” exclaimed Cloudy. “He’s probably the sweetest boy I’ve ever met.”
“I’d like to meet him sometime,” Springtime said. A mischievous grin spread over her face. “I’m okay with you guys visiting one another, but no kissing, okay?”
The corners of Cloudy’s mouth tightened into a frown. She was clearly not amused. “Give me a break, Mommy. I wouldn’t do that.”
Springtime giggled and gave her daughter another hug. “I know, darling. I know. Now why don’t you come with me to the kitchen and help me make a cake for dessert tonight?”
Cloudy obliged, though she was confused. She had been expecting to be well-scolded by her mother about attacking Wylanda and receiving a lecture on respecting others. But Springtime still mentioned noting about the incident. Could it be, Cloudy though, that she doesn’t know? And if so, why did no one tell?
In a few minutes, flour, sugar, eggs, frosting, and other cooking articles were spread on the counter. Springtime gazed at the cookbook and asked Cloudy to hand her whatever needed to go into the wooden mixing bowl. Cloudy worked cheerfully and willingly, but her mind was still filled with the Thanksgiving story. She was dying to know the meaning of Thanksgiving, but had been too afraid to ask Mrs. Ivy.
Cloudy raised her head and looked at Springtime, who was intent on measuring out five cups of flour and dumping it in the bowl. Cloudy took a deep breath and made up her mind. She would ask her mother.
“Mommy?” Cloudy asked, her voice small.
“Yes, sweetheart?” Springtime patiently said.
Cloudy tapped her paw on the counter for a few seconds, then replied, “In history today, my teacher was telling me about this holiday called Thanksgiving.”
Springtime’s eyes lit up. “Ah, yes! Thanksgiving!” Straightening her apron, she narrated, “About three hundred years ago, the Pilgrims left their old home in Leudon and sailed on the Moonflower for sixty-five days before they landed in the New World. Many died of disease or malnutrition that first winter, but come spring, and Indian named Sumosot helped them, as well as Squinto and Missisoit. And that fall, they had the biggest feast probably ever known in all of Dreamlandian history.” She paused and asked, “Can you hand me two eggs?”
Cloudy nosed them across the counter to her. “Mrs. Ivy said the Pilgrims left their old home In order to worship God freely.”
Springtime nodded as she cracked open the eggs. “That’s right. You see, the king at that time was King James I. He was a brutal tyrant who told the Pilgrims that they had to do what he said and to stay with the Church of Anglen. However, the Pilgrims believed that the Church of Anglen taught many things that weren’t taught in the Bible. Some of those Pilgrims called themselves ‘Separatists’ because they broke ties with the Church of Anglen. King James was furious with their decision and even threw some of them in prison just because they believed differently than he did. He didn’t want them to choose what to believe in.”
Cloudy nodded and absently passed her mother the bag of sugar. “Interesting. I didn’t know about King James. He sounds very forceful.”
“Oh, he was. Especially when it came to religion,” answered Springtime, dumping four cups of sugar in the mixing bowl. 
“Were there any mean people on the Moonflower?” Cloudy asked.
Springtime picked up the eggbeater and swirled it around in the cake mix. “Yes. Some sailors hated the Pilgrims for believing in God and praying to Him. In fact, one of those sailors talked often about throwing the Pilgrims to the sharks, but he died of a dreadful disease and was the first to be thrown overboard. Some people believed the hand of God caused him to die.”
“That’s weird,” Cloudy said, “but sort of cool at the same time.” She passed her mother some milk. “Who else was on the ship?”
“Well, let’s see. There was Willie Bronford, the governor; Milan Stondash, the military leader; Elder Brewston, the religious leader of the Pilgrims; Captain Johannes, the captain of the Moonflower; and Jon Howard. He fell overboard during a violent storm but was rescued. The Pilgrims took his rescue as a sign from God that they would make it to the New World.” Springtime took the eggbeater out of the mix. “While all the Pilgrims got along well for the most part, they were not in agreement when it came to landing at the Huckson River.”
“What do you mean?”
Springtime tested the batter to see how thick and smooth it was. “You see, Cloudy, there were two groups of Pilgrims: the Saints and the Strangers. The Strangers wanted to land at the Huckson River, but dangerous shoals on the shoreline prevented that, so they had to sail in a different direction. Needless to say, the Strangers were not happy, and a mutiny nearly occurred before Willie Bronford drew up something called the Moonflower Agreement. It basically said the Pilgrims would all stick together no matter what.”
“Wow!” Cloudy breathed. “My teacher didn’t give this much detail!”
“She’s just trying to keep your knowledge of this spectacular event to your grade level, honey.” Springtime picked up a container of cinnamon and dumped a little into a teaspoon. “Anyway, the Pilgrims all landed at Pimath Plantation and built the Common House that winter, but many people died that first winter of cold, disease, poor nutrition, lack of fresh water, and maybe despair too. But when spring arrived, and Indian named Sumosot befriended the Pilgrims and helped them. He brought Squinto, another Indian, after a few days, and Squinto showed the Pilgrims how to plant corn using herring, a type of fish. Later, Missisoit, his tribe, and the Pilgrims formed a peace treaty with one another. And that autumn, the Pilgrims and the Indians got together for a huge banquet. And that day became known as Thanksgiving.”
Cloudy pondered all this information. “But I don’t understand why we celebrate Thanksgiving,” she said. “What’s the meaning of it?”
Springtime finished mixing all the ingredients together and was now scooping the cake batter into a small round bowl. “Cloudy, we celebrate Thanksgiving so we can remember to be grateful for everything we have. We give thanks for everything God’s given us and what He’s done for us.” She put the eggbeater into the sink and used a butter knife to smooth the top of the mix. “The meaning of Thanksgiving is this, Cloudburst: Be thankful for what you have, big or small, because the Lord has blessed you with it.”
Cloudy stared at her mom as Springtime popped the cake into the oven to bake, then cleaned off the counter. Springtime apparently had learned to be grateful for what she had. She never grumbled about what she didn’t have. Cloudy couldn’t remember a time her mother was ungrateful about anything. I guess what Daddy always says is true, then, Cloudy thought. “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” That meant, her father would explain, that if life threw something hard of unappealing your direction, make the best out of it. Be grateful for what you do have and focus on the bright side instead of sitting in the dark and stewing about how unfair life was.
Springtime guided Cloudy to the sink and helped her rinse the egg yoke and cake mix off her paws, then wiped down the counter with disinfecting wipes. When she finished, Cloudy said softly, “Thanks, Mommy, for telling me about Thanksgiving. I never knew so much about it before.”
“You’re welcome, honey.” Springtime smiled softly. “If you ever want to talk to anyone, your father and I are here. You can tell us anything.”
Cloudy nodded and snuggled up to her mother. Then a question popped into her mind. “Mommy, are we going to do anything for Thanksgiving this year?” she asked.
Springtime chuckled and nodded. “Yes, dear. Your father and I have been talking about hosting a feast on our property and inviting as many people we can, friend or stranger.”
Cloudy started in surprise. “Whoa! You mean we’re just going to be inviting random strangers to our feast?”
“Everyone is welcome, my dear, and who knows? They may respond to the message of the gospel if they haven’t already,” Springtime said cheerfully. “You and your siblings can help. You can invite people from your school, starting tomorrow. Sound good?”
“For sure!” Cloudy barked in excitement and wriggled with happiness. Springtime laughed as she watched her daughter leap about, almost upsetting the trashcan. This was getting too exciting! Thanksgiving was on its way!

  title: "Miriam Capperdale"
  content: |
       The next morning, Cloudy, and her siblings again headed to school. But this morning they had gotten up two hours before the bell in order to have enough time to invite lots of people to the Thanksgiving feast. Cloudy explained that Sniper and his brothers would invite those inside the school while Star and she would invite those outside.
Cloudy and her sister worked hard; in fact, Cloudy later swore that she had never worked so hard on a project as she did on this one! After an hour, they had successfully answered yes to thirty-three of forty invitations. So far, so good. 
Star yawned and leaned against the bus stop sign. “Dang, I’m tired. I wonder how many people the boys managed to invite?”
“Hopefully a lot more than us,” Cloudy said, worriedly surveying the sheet of paper pinned to her clipboard. On the paper were the names of those who were coming to the feast. “Thirty-three isn’t enough for a giant feast.”
“Ah, don’t sweat it,” Star said in an unconcerned tone. “I’m sure a ton of people will show up.”
“I hope so,” Cloudy murmured. Then a thought came to mind. “Hey, Star?”
“Yeah?” Star stretched out her back, bracing herself against the sign by digging her claws into the ground. 
“Did you—um, well—ever tell Mommy or Daddy about my, uh, fight with Wylanda yesterday?”
Star stopped stretching and stared at her sister. “No, of course not.”
Oh.” Cloudy was silent a moment, then continued, “Did anybody else tell?”
“No. We all agreed not to tell,” Star said.
Cloudy was surprised. “Why?”
“We decided it wasn’t your fault,” Star said. “We all said that Wylanda was being a butt to you and that she deserved to be attacked. Maybe that’ll be a lesson to her to be nicer from now on.” She stared at Cloudy, her blue eyes dark and thoughtful. “And also remember what I told you, Cloudy—us telling Mommy and Daddy anything that you’re dealing with won’t teach you to speak up for yourself.”
Cloudy smiled, but the smile was forced. She felt as though she’d been slapped. “Um, well, okay.”
Just then, a young, dark-skinned girl came out of a small white house next to the school. She wore a short brown dress and a gold filigree bracelet with tiny roses painted on it was around her wrist. She walked over to the bus stop, but halted when she saw Star slumped against the sign. “Um, can you please excuse me?” the girl timidly said.
Star jumped a little and stared at the girl. “What? Oh, um, I mean, sure.” She moved a few feet away to make room.
“Thanks,” the girl said shyly. She glanced curiously at the two sisters for a moment, her brown eyes filled with interest. Cloudy and Star looked back just as intently. Then the girl asked, “Have we met?”
“No,” said Star.
Cloudy shook her head. “I don’t think so.”
“Oh. Well, my name’s Miriam Capperdale,” the girl said. She pushed back a lock of her wavy hair. “I’m seven.”
“Well, my name is Star and this is my sister, Cloudy. She’s the prophesied Star Warrior who is to save Dreamland from disaster,” Star explained, opening her blue eyes wide.
Miriam’s eyes shone. She was clearly intrigued. “Really? Wow! Oh my gosh! I can’t believe it! At last, you’re here! We’ve all been waiting for a really long time!”
“Well, your waiting has paid off,” Star dramatically declared. “She has come!”
“Okay, okay,” Cloudy giggled. “Don’t overdo it, Star. But yes, I am the Prophesied One. It’s nice to meet you, Miriam.” She smiled as she glanced at Miriam’s bracelet. “And I especially love your bracelet.”
“Thanks,” Miriam replied, turning it on her wrist. “It was a gift from my grandmother before she died. She gave it to me to remind me to always be grateful for everything we have. I value it highly.”
A gust of wind suddenly blew past and Miriam’s dress twisted around her. “Oh, drat!” Miriam grumbled as she yanked at the dress to straighten it out.
For the first time, Cloudy noted that Miriam’s dress was worn and had patches in it. Miriam noticed Cloudy staring at her clothing, and Cloudy quickly looked away.
“I know what you’re thinking,” Miriam sighed, “Yes, my clothing is not the best. It came from the thrift store, in fact.”
“The thrift store?” Star repeated in disbelief. “Are you a hobo or something?”
“Star!” Cloudy hissed, mortified. “Be quiet! She’s not a hobo!”
“Of course I’m not,” said Miriam, sounding offended. “I live in a house, in case you haven’t noticed. That one.” She pointed to the white house she had come out of.
“Then why are you dressed like a poor person?” asked Star.
Miriam glared at Star. “Because I am poor. Obviously.” She crossed her arms and looked away.
“Oh,” was all Star could say. She felt like an idiot. First she had called Miriam a hobo and then asked a dumb question about Miriam being poor. She had made Miriam feel like a total loser and that wasn’t what she had meant to do at all.
Cloudy gave Miriam a sympathetic look. “Are you having any trouble in your family?” she asked. “Not trying to pry,” she hurriedly added. “I just want to help you, is all.”
Miriam nodded sadly and turned to face Cloudy. “We are having some problems. My dad’s in the hospital because he got into a terrible car accident last month. The doctors aren’t even sure he’s going to make it. And on top of that, Mom can’t pay our bills on the house. If she doesn’t pay them before the month is out, we’ll lose our house!”
“Oh, no!” Cloudy gasped. “That can’t happen! It just can’t!”
“We have to do something,” Star said. “Maybe we can ask our parents and our friends to donate some money to your mom. Or maybe we can sell something. Or maybe we can. . .”
Miriam held up a hand and smiled. “It’s nice of you to try to help me, but this is up to the Lord now. I trust He’ll do what is best.”
“Wait, are you a Christian?” Star asked, astonished.
Miriam nodded. “My whole family is Christian.”
“Our whole family is Christian too,” Cloudy said. “Although Sniper doesn’t really act like he’s one.”
“Who’s Sniper?” Miriam asked.
“Our oldest brother,” Cloudy said.
“Oh.” Miriam pushed back a lock of her black hair and slung her satchel over her shoulder. “Is he mean?”
“Mean enough to save someone’s life,” Star piped in.
“Shh!” Cloudy scolded. “Pipe down, will you, Star?”
Miriam laughed. “Well, he certainly sounds unique. I’d like to meet your family sometime, Cloudy.”
“And I’d like to meet yours,” Cloudy said.
Star cleared her throat and asked in a friendly tone,” So, Miriam, where do you go to school?”
“The public school a few miles down the road,” Miriam answered. She looked up to the sky. “It’s not the best, but I do have some friends there.”
“Really?” Cloudy’s eyes glowed. “Perfect!”
Miriam blinked, startled. “Uh, pardon me?”
“Oh, I guess I didn’t tell you,” Cloudy said. “You see, I live in that house right across from here, and my parents are hosting a Thanksgiving feast there next Thursday. Lots of people will be there. You and your family and friends are invited.”
“Awesome,” Miriam said. “Wait, does it cost anything to get in?”
“Nope. It’s free of charge,” Star said.
“Cool. Then count me in,” Miriam said. “I’ll tell my mom after I get home from school.”
The big yellow school bus pulled up at that moment. “Oh, I’ve gotta go. See you guys later!” Miriam called, and hopped onto the bus. The doors slid shut and the bus pulled away into the cold afternoon, Miriam waving to them from the window. Cloudy and Star waved in return.
Star blew out her breath. “Well, that went well.”
Cloudy just gave her the death stare. “Hmph.”
“What?” demanded Star. “Why are you glaring at me like that?”
“Because you need to learn to shut your mouth,” Cloudy snapped. “You made poor Miriam feel like dirt!”
“Why, just because I asked if she was poor?” Star returned.
“No, because you basically insinuated she was a destitute, homeless outcast,” Cloudy growled. “That’s going too far.”
“Okay, okay. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make it sound like that, but I’ve never seen a girl dressed so plainly as her.”
“So what is she wears rags and goes to the worst school on the planet?” Cloud said. “She’s a nice girl.”
“I know,” Star said sheepishly.
“Hey, girls!” Sniper called, banging open the double doors and bounding toward them with his brothers in tow. “Guess what? We got fifty-three people to come!”
“Awesome!” Cloudy said happily. “Let’s see, thirty-four plus fifty-three equals. . .” She paused a second to do some mental math. “. . .equals eighty-seven!”
“Don’t forget these peoples’ families as well as Miriam and her friends,” Star reminded her.
“Oh, yeah.”
“Wait, you lost me,” Yodi said. “Who’s Miriam?”
“Miriam Capperdale. She’s a girl who lives next door to this school. She’s coming to the feast and bringing her friends,” Star said.
“Miriam Capperdale, eh? Never heard of her,” said Sharkell.
“Of course not. You haven’t met her,” Star said with a snort of contempt. “But she’s very kind and Christian like us.”
“Radical!” Pancake cheered. “I have to meet this girl!”
“Well, you’ll have your chance soon enough,” Star chuckled. “Thanksgiving’s right around the corner.”
Cloudy looked up to the sky and smiled softly. She was glad Miriam had taken such a liking to them, but was concerned for her family. Cloudy decided to talk to her parents that night to see what they could do to help Miriam.
Cloudy heard Star mention the words “Wylanda Coven” and instantly tuned back in to the conversation. 
“Hey, you boys didn’t invite Wylanda Coven, did you?” Star asked suspiciously.
Sniper pretended to gag.
“Seriously?” Waffle said, raising an eyebrow. “I hope you’re joking. I’d throw myself into a pit full of poisonous scorpions before I’d invite Wylanda to our Thanksgiving feast.”
“I know. I just wanted to make sure,” Star said. She grinned. “Imagine if she did get invited!”
“She’s ruin the event before it even started!” Sniper declared.
“Yeah, I bet she’d gorge herself on the turkey,” Yodi giggled. “Or maybe she’d say she’s the Thanksgiving queen and make everyone do exactly as she says.”
“Gross,” Star muttered. “I’m just glad she’s not invited. It’s bad enough we have to be with her in school. Just for once I’d like to not see her anywhere near us.”
“I’d like it if she wasn’t anywhere near us at all, but that won’t happen unless she moves away or dies,” Sharkell said lightly.
Cloudy gasped in shock. “Sharkell! Are you wishing death to Wylanda?”
“No, of course not,” Sharkell said. “I’m just saying I wish she would stay away from us for good.”
Just then, the students began pouring in droves into the school. From where she stood, Cloudy could hear the faint ringing of the bell announcing the start of class. “Let’s go!” Sniper sang, dashing toward the front doors, his brothers and sisters right on his tail.
                         
                                                     *   *   *   *   *

That night, Cloudy’s family sat around the dinner table eating a delicious supper of chicken, spaghetti and meatballs, and the leftovers of the cake that Cloudy had helped make yesterday. 
“So, children, have a good day at school?” Springtime asked.
“Oh, yes,” Sniper mumbled, stuffing spaghetti and meatballs into his mouth. “It was so awesome! We had the best day ever!” He gulped his lemonade down, spilling most of it onto his chest. Then he set the glass down and licked the lemonade around his mouth, the sweet liquid dripping down his chin. Spaghetti sauce lathered his face and a noodle was draped over his nose. Cloudy and Star burst into giggles at his appearance and Yodi goggled while Sharkell, Pancake, and Waffle looked away in disgust, curling their lips in distaste.
Sniper sighed deeply and grinned, his teeth covered with sauce. “Boy, this is a good dinner, Mommy.”
“Eww! Sniper, that’s absolutely revolting!” Springtime exclaimed.
“What is?” wondered Sniper.
“Look in the wall mirror over there,” Showerstorm ordered.
Sniper did and gasped when he saw his reflection. “Oh, man! Is that really me?!”
“Yes,” Springtime answered dryly. Then should couldn’t contain herself. She burst into uncontrollable laughter, nearly falling off her chair. The puppies laughed too and so did Showerstorm, though he tried to pretend he wasn’t.
“Um, I’ll be right back,” Sniper said, jumping from his seat and racing to the bathroom. The puppies started laughing all over again.
“Okay, everyone, settle down,” Showerstorm chuckled.
Cloudy flashed a smile and took a bite of cake. She had confess that while Sniper was annoying, he was also a really good mealtime entertainer. Not to mention the class clown and the practical jokester and. . .
“Cloudy, did you hear what I asked you?” Springtime’s voice cut into Cloudy’s thoughts. Startled, Cloudy looked up at her mother.
“Um, I’m sorry, Mommy, I didn’t hear you. I was thinking about something else.”
“I asked, how many people did you kids invite today?” asked Springtime.
Cloudy couldn’t give her an exact number since she didn’t know how many people were actually coming. “Over a hundred,” was all she said.
“Awesome. Your father and I invite a few people too.”
“Who did you invite?” Star wondered.
“Your father invited a few of his coworkers down at the bank,” Springtime said. “I went down to the mall earlier today and invited a few kids and their families. Oh, and this woman named Scazzarda Stellarum is coming with her son. I also ran into Shannon Coven and invited her too, as well as . .” 
“Shannon who?!” Cloudy exclaimed, her eyes full of shock. 
Springtime turned her head and gave her a surprised look. “Shannon Coven, honey. You know the Covens; their daughter goes to your school, she told me.”
Sharkell slapped his forehead with his paw and groaned loudly.
“NOOOO!” Yodi yelled.
“What’s the matter?” Showerstorm asked.
“Oh, nothing,” Cloudy said quickly. She wasn’t ready to tell her parents that Wylanda was a bully. “We-We were just surprised that you invited the Covens. I mean, I assumed a wealthy family like them wouldn’t want to attend out meager feast.”
Springtime stared at Cloudy as if she were an alien from outer space. “Cloudy, what are you talking about? Why can’t I invite them just because our feast is meager? It’s not about the feast. It’s about friendship and love between stranger and friend. Don’t forget that.”
Cloudy ran a paw across the smooth mahogany tabletop. Why could she just never seem to explain to her mother a lot of the things on her mind?
“Oh, Mommy,” Star said, tugging at her mother’s leg. Springtime looked down at her, a mild expression of puzzlement crossing her face. “We met this Christian girl named Miriam Capperdale at the bus stop today, and she lives next door to our school. She said her mother was going to lose her house because the bills can’t be paid, and they have to be paid before the month is out.” She sat back in her seat. “Can’t we help them?”
Springtime’s eyes clouded. “I don’t know,” she said slowly. “I never met this family. I don’t even know if Miriam was telling the truth or not.”
“But she said. . .”
“People can say anything they want to, darling, but it doesn’t make it true,” Springtime returned, a little severely. “Don’t fall for everything you hear.”
“But Mommy!” Star burst out. “Her dress was old and patched and she goes to a public school! Aren’t public schools free?”
“Yes, but what does that have to do with. . .”
“If public schools are free,” Star broke in, “then maybe her mother sent her there because she was unable to pay for a proper school.”
“Or she doesn’t want to bother spending any money,” Springtime shot back.
“Okay, stop,” Showerstorm said firmly. “Star, we will check in with this family tomorrow. If they are everything you say they are, then we will try to help them. But if not, let this be a lesson to you children not to be gullible. Do you understand?”
“Yes, Daddy,” Star sighed, lowering her head.
Cloudy was worried. What if Miriam and her family were lying about who they really were?

                                                  *   *   *   *   *

The next afternoon, Cloudy walked in the front door with her siblings in tow. Ignoring them, she set the picnic basket down and walked into the kitchen. There she saw her parents by the stove, talking to one another in low voices. Their tones were a mixture of concern and excitement, but Cloudy was unable to hear a single sentence of what they were saying.
Springtime looked up at the moment and saw Cloudy. Instantly, she stopped talking and smiled cheerfully. “Hello, dear!” she said.
“What’s happening?” Cloudy asked, rushing up to them.
Showerstorm chuckled slightly. “I guess Star was right.”
“Huh?” Cloudy was puzzled.
“I should have known she was telling the truth,” he went on.
“Can you talk in English and please tell me what’s going on?” Cloudy begged. “Telling the truth about what?”
“Miriam, of course,” Springtime said. “Why, we went over to her house this afternoon while you were having your picnic in the park, and you should have seen her house. It was tiny as heck and the walls were dirty and the paint was chipped, and the back of the roof looked pretty bad too. The electricity doesn’t work right, either.”
“Not to mention we checked online today and found that indeed the bank is demanding heavy fines from Miriam’s mother,” Showerstorm sighed. “Star was right. I should have known.”
“Ohh, is there nothing we can do?!” Cloudy exclaimed in frustration, stamping her foot. “Miriam can’t live on the street and neither can her mother!”
“Calm down, my dear,” Springtime said gently. “We have an idea, but we’ll keep it secret for now. I don’t want to reveal it lest it doesn’t work, you know?”
Cloudy wasn’t sure she did know, but she said, “Yes, Mommy.”
Springtime hugged her daughter. “My dear, the Lord is with the Capperdales and He is with us. If He wills it, Miriam and her mother will not be kicked out of their house. He will reveal the answer in time. But we must trust Him because it is not in our hands—or maybe paws is the better term. Understand?”
Cloudy looked wonderingly at her mother, and she suddenly found herself smiling. “Yes, Mommy, I understand.” She did a little dance around the room. “Now I really can’t wait for Thanksgiving!”

      title: "Meeting the Stellarums"
      content: |
        A blond-haired girl about seven years old scurried through the thick crowd milling in front of Cloudy’s house and hurried up to the front porch. “Excuse me?” she asked Springtime, who was standing in front of the grill talking to Springtime.
Springtime turned her head and glanced down at the girl. “Yes?” 
“Do you have a bathroom here?”
“Yes, just inside.”
“Thanks,” the little girl said, darting into the house. Springtime grinned and called after her, “You’re welcome.”
It was Thanksgiving Day, and the outing was in full swing. The children were playing on a makeshift playground while the adults chatted or helped cook the food needed for the big feast that would take place later that evening. The sky was a cloudless blue and the sun warmed everyone through, though it was not even sixty degrees. The scent of the roses on the bushes in front of the house wafted through the air and created a lovely fragrance. A raven called out to another raven, and a third raven answered them. A goose honked as it flew overhead.
Showerstorm shook his head in amazement when he saw how many were gathered. “This place is packed!” he exclaimed.
“Must be a million people here,” joked Springtime. “Just kidding. Still, I’m surprised so many people turned out here.”
“I hope they’ll have a great day,” the blond-haired child said as she came out the front door. She smiled at Springtime and Showerstorm and then darted away.
“Cute kid,” Showerstorm said.
“Isn’t that Miriam’s friend? The Palmer girl?” Springtime asked.
“Yes, I believe it is.”
“She has a twin sister.”
“I know. I saw. They look exactly the same. Wonder how their parents can tell them apart!”
“I’m sure they have their ways,” Springtime said calmly. Then she nervously cast a look around. “Oh, I hope our plan works. Miriam’s future may depend on it.” She bit her lip in anxiety. “What if these people don’t cooperate?”
“Don’t doubt your plan once it’s underway. If you have one, then stick with it until the end,” said Showerstorm.
Springtime nodded, feeling reassured. She smiled at her darling husband. One of the nicest characteristics about him was that he had the ability to make anyone feel  better with just a few comforting words. Just like his father, she thought. Scooting a few feet over to him, she gave him a gentle hug, and he fondly returned the embrace.

                                                   *   *   *   *   *

Cloudy impatiently peered over the heads of the crowd from her position in the tree house her parents and a few of the neighbors had built a few days earlier. She was waiting for Eloise Palmer, one of Miriam’s friends and a strong Christian. Nika Palmer, Eloise’s younger twin sister, was sitting on the lone swing attached to the tree house. Zach Linky, a handsome nine-year-old and another one of Miriam’s friends, sat on the slide. Arrow and Lily, a German Shepherd from Cloudy’s class, sat on the ground together behind the tree house. Miriam was standing underneath one of the tree’s overhanging branches. She was wearing her rose bracelet again. Star, bored, balanced easily on the middle of the seesaw.
“Come on, Eloise, hurry up,” Lily muttered, sighing out loud.
Zach yawned. “What’s the hurry, Lily?” he called back to her. “It’s not like we’re doing anything right now, ya know.”
“We are about to play the prince rescuing the princess from the pirates,” Cloudy called down to him, rolling her eyes. “Sniper and his brothers just need to get the costumes first.”
Zach snorted and swatted at a mosquito on his arm. “Your brothers are really into pirates, aren’t they?”
“Oh, yeah. They even dressed up as pirates for Halloween!” Cloudy sighed loudly and raised her eyes to the heavens. “I mean, they can pursue whatever passions they want, but this is honestly getting a bit out of hand.”
“Don’t you mean paw?” Zach said, grinning. His brown eyes twinkled with amusement.
“Very funny, Zach,” Cloudy said.
“But if you’re getting tired of them playing pirates, then why play this game?” Nika asked, looking up at Cloudy. She was forced to squint against the glare of the afternoon sun.
“Because I’m practically bored and this is only game they suggested that actually seemed fun.”
“Ironic,” Miriam murmured.
“Hi, guys, I’m back,” panted Eloise as she darted over to them. “Sniper and the other boys are right behind me with the costumes.”
“Oh, joy,” Star said sarcastically. “I can’t wait. I’m dying from impatience.”
“Star, cut with the sarcasm,” Zach ordered sternly. “You never know, this could be fun.”
“Yeah, perhaps, but my definition of fun is not always my brothers’ definition of fun.”
Before Zach could say anything else, Cloudy’s brothers reappeared with the costumes. “All right, men—and ladies,” Sniper said importantly. “Here are your roles. I am the pirate leader, Cap’n Dave, and Yodi and Waffle are my men.”
“Why do we have to be your men?” Yodi muttered quietly. Sniper didn’t hear him, but Cloudy did.
“Pancake and Sharkell are the princess’s knights, and Arrow is the prince. Zach, Eloise, Nika, Lily, and Miriam are the princess’s servants; Cloudy, you are the princess; and Star, you are Cloudy’s lady-in-waiting.”
“Oh, great,” Star mumbled to herself. To Sniper she shouted, “And I’m a lady just waiting for you to start this dumb game so we can hurry up and end it!”
Sniper stared at her for a moment, his face breaking into a scowl. “It’s not dumb. Heck, this’ll be the most awesome game you’ve ever played in your whole life!”
“I doubt that, Cap’n Dave,” Star retorted. “By the way, what kind of name is that? That’s the most wimpy pirate name ever! That doesn’t even sound scary; it just sounds lame. Why not choose a name like Bloodthirsty Ben Or Blackbeard Barney?”
“No way! Cap’n Dave’s amazing! He’s the most famous pirate ever!” 
“Grow up, Sniper! Cap’n Dave isn’t even real! He’s a character from a stupid movie!” Star shouted.
“He’s real if I say he is!” Sniper yelled.
“Okay, can we just play now?” demanded Yodi, breaking up the argument. “And for the record, Sniper,  no one cares if Cap’n Dave is real or not. At least they shouldn’t.”
“Yodi’s right! Let’s get our costumes on and get in the bouncy castle!” Lily said.
The children slipped into the garments that were to serve as costumes and adjusted them to their proper size. When they finished, they stood around a few moments gazing at one another.
“Do I look as silly as you do?” Eloise asked Star.
Star grunted in response as she gazed with disgust upon the blue cloak she was wearing. “This costume is hideous,” she grumbled. She peered more closely at it. “Wait a minute. This is Daddy’s! Sniper, why did you give me a boy’s cloak!”
“Aw, be quiet and live with it,” was Sharkell’s response.
“Hey,” Cloudy demanded suspiciously as she surveyed the pastel-pink cloak wrapped around her shoulders. “Isn’t this Mommy’s?”
“Yeah, duh,” Sniper said. He looked odd with his black eye patch and rusted cutlass.
“What!” Lily burst out. “You took it out of her room?!”
“Of course,” Sniper replied. “There aren’t many princess costumes lying around the house, so I had to scrounge up something. And this was it.”
Cloudy’s eyes popped wide open when she saw a black velvet case sitting on the grass right next to her. “Oh, no. No. Sniper, did you—? You didn’t!”
“Yeah, I did,” Sniper said proudly. “Now you can be a real princess!”
“What is it?” Nika asked, kneeling next to the case and gently lifting the lid. Eloise peered over her shoulder, and both gasped. 
Sitting in the case on a bed of soft silk was a magnificent diamond crown. Emeralds and rubies had been skillfully embedded into it and a giant opal sat right in the center on the front of the crown. The sunlight flashed on the jewels and radiated its beauty into the chilly afternoon. When Nika bent sideways while looking at the crown, she could see a rainbow shimmering inside it.
“This is amazing!” Eloise gasped. “Is this your mother’s, Cloudy?”
“Yes, it is,” Cloudy said angrily. “It belonged to an ancient queen and it is very priceless!”
“You mean this is authentic?” Nika asked, wide-eyed.
“Yes, and very fragile.”
Nika winced and shut the lid. She didn’t want anything to happen to so valuable a treasure. “Sniper, Cloudy can’t wear this. It could break,” she said gently. “You need to take it back inside.”
“No, I’m going to do it,” Miriam said. She stooped and gently lifted the case into her arms, holding it gently as if it were a child. “It’s a miracle it was able to come out here in one piece. Now I’m gonna make sure it gets back inside in one piece. See you in a minute.” She walked off and mingled with the crowd until they could no longer see her.
“You need to bring this back too,” Cloudy said, pulling off the pink cloak and  handing it to Sniper. “Mommy doesn’t want this getting ruined. It’s all she has left of her mother.”
“No way! You need to have something to wear!” Sniper insisted. “A princess can’t  just wear nothing!”
“Did you even ask her before taking that—or the crown?” Zach asked, crossing his arms. 
A guilty look crossed Sniper’s face, and the others interpreted that as a no. “But we already have it. We might as well use it,” he pointed out. He shrugged and added, “Besides, it’s a lot less likely to get ruined than the crown was.”
Thought Cloudy hated to admit it, her brother was right. “Fine,” she consented. “But I swear, if anything happens to it. . .”
“Nothing’s gonna happen to it,” Star said pointedly. “Can we just play now?”
“Wait for Miriam,” Nika said.
In a minute, Miriam came back, and now the fun could start. “The tree house,” Sniper said, “can be the tower in which the princess is imprisoned.  And of course, the bouncy castle is the castle in which the princess lives. Got it? Let’s go!”
Cloudy gingerly stepped into the castle and sat down on the imaginary throne, her knights, servants, and lady-in-waiting surrounding her.  Arrow sat beside her.
“What would thou have us do, O princess?” Star said, bowing low.
“I want you, O my lady-in-waiting and loyal knights and servants, to guard me from the evil pirate band,” Cloudy replied in a high-pitched tone. “They will do everything they can to capture me and take over the throne!”
“With all due respect, Your Grace,” Pancake said, his blueish-white cloak reflecting the dim light, “there is no possible way they could take you down. You are too strong and brave. You have conquered every villain that has tried to harm you!”
“Don’t waste your flattery on me,” Cloudy said lightly. “Alas! flattery is but vanity.”
“True, my princess,” Arrow said. “As the wise king Solomon once said in his book of Ecclesiastes, ‘All is vanity.’”
“Your Highness,” Eloise said, curtsying, “you remind me of a great philosopher who lived two hundred years ago. He spake almost the exact words as you. Do you know of whom I speak? It was the great Germani, the one who wrote the book Imagination of the Mind.”
“Yes, Germani,” Arrow said thoughtfully. “A good Christian, he was, but he had some odd ideas.”
“Yeah, like that one idea he had after he went sort of wacky,” Sharkell said. “This man literally thought that he was imagining everyone he saw.” His eyes grew wide and his voice became dramatic. “But perhaps, O prince and princess, he was right! Perhaps we are just imagining one another! Perhaps none of us are real! I could be imagining you and never even know it! Perhaps you—”
“Okay, halt,” Cloudy ordered. “I promise that we are not imagining each other.”
“How do you know?” Sharkell asked, for once forgetting to be respectful.
“Because my imagination could never come up with someone like you,” Cloudy said in a bold tone, and the Palmer sisters broke into laughter.
“Well, your imagination isn’t very great, then!” Sharkell snapped back. That time, everyone burst out laughing to the point where their sides began to hurt.
Just then, Sniper, Yodi, and Waffle burst into the castle and began attacking the knights. Pancake pretended to be stabbed to death by Waffle’s cutlass and fell prostrate onto the floor, motionless. Sharkell slipped out the door and tried to run away, but Yodi overtook him and brought him down.
“Aye, lassie,” Sniper said with a wicked grin, brandishing his cutlass in Cloudy’s face as she sat frozen in fear. “Ye know me. I am Cap’n Dave and I have come to take the throne from ye!”
“Stay away from my princess!” Arrow barked, drawing his rapier and thrusting it at Sniper. Sniper avoided it and knocked Arrow’s word to the floor, leaving him weaponless.
“Ha, ha! What will ye do now?” Sniper cackled with glee. “Ye are powerless against the great Cap’n Dave and his band!” He turned to Yodi and Sharkell and commanded: “Barney, Mustafa, kill all but the princess! Spare no other!”
Yodi and Sharkell jumped to do Sniper’s bidding. The servants screamed in fear as they all tried to get away from the vicious pirates, but there was nothing they could do. They were all killed except for Star, Arrow, and Eloise, for they managed to escape out the door and run for their lives.
Sniper growled as he realized that three of the royal inhabitants had escaped, including the prince. “Well, they are of no use to us anyway,” he comforted himself. “We have the princess. That’s all we were after.” To his loyal followers he commanded, “Take the princess to the Tower of Torture. She will learn what happens to her if she refuses to hand over the throne to us!”
“Help! Help!” Cloudy cried in her princess’s voice as the pirates dragged her to the tree house and forced her to climb the ladder. Then they climbed up after her.
Down below, hidden in the deep shadows, stood Prince Arrow as he gazed bravely up at the tower in which his love was imprisoned. Star and Eloise stood with him.
“What shall we do, Your Highness?” Star whispered. “Thy princess is a prisoner in yonder tower!”
Arrow had to smile. Though Star had formerly acted like she didn’t like playing this game, she now seemed to be enjoying it immensely.
“Yes, we must save her!” Eloise whispered fearfully.
“I have an idea,” Arrow said quietly. “I shall climb up and fight Cap’n Dave myself and rescue the princess!”
“How, Your Grace?” Star asked. “You have no weapon.”
“I do,” Eloise answered, drawing out Sharkell’s sword from beneath her dress and handing it to Arrow. “I picked it up as we ran away from the castle.”
Arrow accepted the sword and raised it high. “Stay here,” he whispered fiercely. “I will go and save Princess Cloudy!”
“Be careful, Your Majesty,” Star begged.
“I will.”
Arrow stole carefully toward the tower, taking great care not to be seen by Yodi, who was on guard. For a moment Arrow was undecided. Should he storm the tower and fight the pirates? Should he sneak in by a different way? Should he distract the guard?
Arrow took a long, deep breath and made his decision. He was going to storm the tower. He quickly climbed the ladder and struck down the guard before he could react. Sniper whirled and saw Arrow, his sword drawn, standing over Yodi, who was pretending to be dead.
“How did ye barge in here?” Sniper demanded, drawing his cutlass.
“Arrow!” gasped Cloudy.
“Cloudy!” Arrow exclaimed.
“Ye are dead!” Sniper roared, charging toward Arrow at full speed.
“No!” Cloudy screamed, covering her eyes with her front paws.
Thankfully, Arrow leaped aside and avoided being stabbed. Sword in his mouth, he chased Sniper in circles around the tower.
Star and Eloise climbed the ladder and jumped into the middle of the battle, Eloise holding a dagger.
“Let the princess go!” Star cried.
“O lady-in-waiting and Sharrone, what are you doing?!” Cloudy shouted.
“Defending thee!” Eloise called, striking down Waffle, who had heard the commotion and had come running in from the next room. “Quickly, princess! Escape while there is still time!”
“I will not leave my prince!”
The price chased Cap’n Dave out onto the balcony of the tower, and there they stood, several thousand feet above the ground. Sniper raised his shield as Arrow drove his sword at him and knocked the shield over the edge of the railing. It careened wildly toward the ground below. . .
“Ouch!” came a woman’s yell from somewhere down below. Arrow and Sniper froze for a minute, looking at one another. Then Arrow cautiously stepped to the edge of the balcony and peered over the railing at a blond-haired woman rubbing her head, a peeved expression on her face. “Who hit me with that shield?” she muttered.
“Sorry about that,” Arrow called down to her.
Surprised, the woman looked up at Arrow dressed in his prince outfit. Blinking a few times, she asked, “Did you throw that?”
“Throw what?” Arrow wondered.
The woman pointed to the shield lying on the ground nearby. “That.”
“Nobody threw it. My friend and I were playing and I knocked the shield away from him.”
Instantly, the woman looked contrite. “Oh.” She glanced around, then up at Arrow again. “Who else is over here with you?”
One by one, Cloudy and her friends abandoned the game and met together in front of the tree house. The woman carefully counted them and said in amazement, “Thirteen children. My, that’s a lot.”
Cloudy noticed for the first time that the woman was wearing a white rose in her hair.
“Mother!” came a shout from nearby. Cloudy turned her head and saw a masked knight wearing a navy-blue cape, gray pauldrons with yellow lining, and a rapier in a brown sheath running toward the woman. He stopped in front of her, breathless. “Are you okay?”
“Yes, I’m okay, dear,” the woman said gently. She seemed touched by her son’s concern.
“Whoa, hello,” Sniper muttered to Yodi. “That guy’s rocking his Halloween costume a little too late, isn’t he?”
“Excuse me?” the woman said sharply, snapping her head toward Sniper. “My son is not wearing a Halloween costume. This is his regular clothing.”
Sniper shut his mouth and remained silent.
“Umm, what’s your name?” Cloudy asked the woman.
“My name is Scazzarda Stellarum. This is my son, Magnus,” the woman replied.
“Stellarum?” Star repeated. “Mommy told us she invited you.”
“Yes, that’s right.”
“You look like a really nice lady,” Nika said shyly. “You almost remind me of my mother.”
“Yeah, you do,” Eloise agreed. “She kinda looks like you.”
Scazzarda chuckled. “I’m glad to hear that. Yes, I am a very kind person. And I’m sure your mother’s a very nice woman as well. I’d like to meet her.” She eyed each of the children in turn. “What are your names?”
One by one, the children told her their names. Cloudy went last. “My name is Cloudburst, but I prefer to be called Cloudy. I am the Prophesied Star Warrior who will save Dreamland.”
Scazzarda started, then exclaimed, “Why, I had no idea! I can’t believe my eyes! You’re here at last!”
The knight said not a word, but his eyes flashed light green.
“Ah! Hey! Your son’s eyes just turned green!” Zach told Scazzarda. He sounded a bit frightened.
Scazzarda laughed, her laugh sounding the patter of rain on a summer day. “Oh, don’t be alarmed. His eyes change colors depending on what his emotions are. Yellow is his normal eye color.  They turn light green when he’s deep in thought. They turn blue when he’s happy or calm, dark green when he’s anxious, orange when he’s confused, red when he’s angry, pink when he’s amused, purple when he’s in love. . .”
“Mother,” the knight said sternly, clearly embarrassed. Cloudy stifled her laughter, pretending to clear her throat.
“. . .and white when he’s shocked, scared, or fearful of others’ lives,” Scazzarda finished. “I have learned to read his emotions quite well.”
“I can believe that. After all, he is your son,” said Miriam.
Sniper was studying the knight’s clothing. “Hey, Magnet!” he shouted. “Are you a soldier or something?”
“My name is Magnus, and yes, I am a soldier,” the knight said shortly. He didn’t seem to want to volunteer any more information on the subject.
“Magnus is a wonderful name,” Nika said sincerely, clasping her hands in front of her. “Who named you that?”
The knight stood looking away toward Whispy Woods. He visibly tensed, and Cloudy started to get concerned. “My father,” he said in a tone so quiet that Nika barely heard him.
Nika turned to Cloudy, jerked her thumb at the knight, and mouthed, “What’s up with this guy?!”
Cloudy shrugged, wishing she knew, but she didn’t. It wasn’t her business, anyhow; it was Magnus’. But his strange behavior did make her wonder—what was the matter with him?
“Well, well,” came a chilly voice from behind the group. “What are you all standing around here for? Having a meeting?”
“Oh, no,” whispered Star.
Sharkell’s eyes narrowed. “It can’t be.”
Cloudy was stunned. Slowly, she turned and looked straight into the eyes of Wylanda Coven. Wylanda wore a stunning aqua-colored dress and a brown headband studded with tiny pumpkins, and a turkey charm bracelet hung around her wrist. A pink porcelain rose hung on a golden chain about her neck.
“Well, I didn’t want to go to your lame party, but Mom decided it would be fun, so here I am,” Wylanda said snottily.  Her gaze rested upon Scazzarda and the knight, and a disgusted look settled over her features. “Are you having a meeting with this old hag here?”
Cloudy and Star gasped and the boys looked ready to throw hands. Scazzarda looked hurt, but she maintained her dignity and politely replied, “We’re not having a meeting; we’re just chatting. My name is Scazzarda Stellarum, in case you were wondering.”
“I wasn’t, but thanks,” Wylanda said insincerely. She sniffed and turned up her nose at the knight, who watched her with steely eyes. “And who is this? A blueberry?”
“His father must be a strawberry, then,” said Wylanda. She looked at Scazzarda. “And with that mussed, dirty yellow dress of yours, you could be a squashed, inedible banana.”
Cloudy’s mouth dropped open. She stared, speechless, at Wylanda. How could she even think of saying such rude things to an adult? Just because Scazzarda was older than the rest of them or because the knight looked odd didn’t give Wylanda a right to make fun of them.
“Someone please give me the go-ahead to slap this girl in the face,” Pancake hissed.
“Yeah. She deserves it,” Star whispered. “She can’t get away with being mean to the Stellarums—or anyone else.”
The knight’s eyes glowed a bright red, and Cloudy found herself getting nervous. “You do not talk to my mother that way.”
Wylanda scoffed and burst out laughing. “Ha! I knew your father was a strawberry! Your eyes are red just like a strawberry!”
“Yeah, and my face is turning red with anger,” Eloise said under her breath. “I’m seeing red—never mind, I’m cracking too many jokes.”
Star did her best to suppress her laughter. Zach hid a smile.
Wylanda then glared with distaste at the children’s costumes. “What kind of getup are you all wearing?” she demanded. “Yo, this is, like, last year’s fashion, okay? You all just totally put the uncool in school with these freaky clothes.”
“Shut up, Wylanda,” Sniper said curtly. “We were playing a game.”
“Oh? What game is that? A fashion contest?” Wylanda asked. “If so, then I say all of you lose. You have no clue what it means to be cool.” She tossed her head, causing her brown corkscrew curls to dance. “In fact, you only know what it’s like to be suckers. You all belong in the geek squad. Except for you,” she told the knight. “You belong in a grocery store. Though it would probably be a waste of time to sit around in the produce section, ‘cause I don’t know who in their right mind would want to buy such an ugly fruit as you.”
Some people overheard Wylanda’s statement and snickered. Scazzarda bit her lip. She could see how upset her son was getting and knew that if somebody didn’t make Wylanda be quiet, he could blow up and do something dangerous.
“Cut it out and stop being mean, Wylanda,” Sharkell ordered. “Magnus can’t help the way he looks.”
“I agree,” Wylanda said sarcastically. “Magnet can’t help the way he looks. Hey, come to think of it, that’s a good name for him because he attracts ugliness.”
“Wylanda!” Star yelled. “Shut your trap!”
“Yeah! What’s your problem?” Cloudy asked. “Why do you enjoy being so mean?”
Wylanda smirked in answer and tossed her head again, then walked off without so much as a backward glance. Cloudy shook her head in exasperation. Wylanda had to be dealt with or else she would cause a riot.

      title: "Wylanda's Ingraitude"
      content: |
        Cloudy watched Wylanda stalk off, her hair blowing back in a light breeze, the hem of her dress flapping lazily. When she had disappeared among the thick crowd, Cloudy turned to the knight and apologized, “I’m sorry about Wylanda, Magnus. She’s quite rude to everyone she meets except for those who are in her social status lane.”
The knight bowed his head, extremely uncomfortable. Uncomfortable both with being made fun of and being the center of someone’s sympathy, which he absolutely hated. He managed a smile. “It’s okay, Cloudy. It wasn’t your fault.”
“Dang right it wasn’t her fault!” said Eloise. “Why, I bet you anything Wylanda’s parents don’t raise her right! No wonder she’s a spoiled brat!”
Sharkell tilted his head. “But if so, Eloise, why do they send her to a Christian school? Why bother to spend all that money when they could just get her into the local public school for free?”
Eloise shrugged. “I wish I knew that part of the puzzle.” She scowled angrily. “But nonetheless, Wylanda should know better than to behave so irrationally.”
Scazzarda brushed an ant off her dress. “Now, now, kids. We may not understand exactly why Wylanda acts the way she does, but the important thing is to treat her with kindness.” She shook her head a little sadly. “I think that girl may have some personality problems linked to her past.”
Cloudy frowned, her eyes thoughtful.
Star paid little attention to Scazzarda’s words. Sitting down and scratching her ear, she addressed herself directly to her friends. “Speaking of Wylanda’s parents, have you guys even seen them? They don’t like anything like Wylanda. They have dark skin, too, unlike her.”
Sniper scoffed. “So? That doesn’t mean anything.”
“It might,” Star told him, briefly detaining from her ear-scratching and looking at him. “She could be adopted.”
“Or maybe her parents’ family lines are mixed,” Sniper pointed out. “Maybe one line has dark skin color and the other light.”
“Maybe.” Star sighed deeply. “But even their physical features aren’t the same. They look completely different.”
“Doesn’t mean she’s adopted,” Sniper said. Then his face lit up and he grinned. “Maybe she was kidnapped like that girl in the movie Tangled was by that creepy woman.”
“Okay, going a little too far there, Sniper,” responded Cloudy, giving him a sideways look. “But maybe Star’s right. Maybe the girl really is adopted.”
“Who cares if she is? Doesn’t give her a right to be mean, does it?” Sharkell snapped. “She should learn to be nicer to us.”
“Well, maybe we should learn to be nicer to her,” Cloudy retorted.
“Huh?!” Sniper exclaimed, completely taken aback. “What are you talking about?”
“We haven’t exactly been very nice to her,” Cloudy admitted. “When she said mean things to us, we reacted rudely, though some of us might not have known it. Maybe we thought we were handling the situation the way it was supposed to be handled, but that’s not the case. In hindsight, we’re really acting just as bad as she is.”
Sniper was too stunned to speak, but Sharkell asked, “What showed you we were doing that, Cloudy?”
Cloudy cast a glance at Scazzarda. “Miss Scazzarda did. It was what she said about treating Wylanda with kindness that really got me thinking, and it occurred to me that that was not what we have been doing. Rather, it was the—” She hunted for the right words. “—the polar opposite.”
“Oh. . .” Sharkell’s voice trailed off.
Sniper finally spoke. “But why should we treat someone with kindness when they’ve been so mean to us?”
“Gosh, Sniper!” Cloudy burst out, frustrated with him. She stood up straight, her tail erect and her voice loud as she glared angrily into the wide, astonished eyes of her older brother. “Even God tells us to love and treat our enemies with kindness! Don’t you ever read God’s Word?”
Sniper’s response sent a shock wave through her body: “Don’t you?”
The fire melted out of Cloudy’s eyes. She stared at Sniper, his eyes glaring defiantly into hers, his angry look communicating something to her. And she suddenly understood. Why was she bearing down on her brother for something she was guilty of as well? Jesus’ words from Matthew 7:1-5 popped into her mind:
“Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye.”
The passage was not referring to literal specks and logs, but rather sin. Two or more people who have committed the same sin cannot judge one another because they are all guilty. It was like scolding your little sister for her theft of a cookie from Mom’s cookie jar when you stole a cookie too.
Cloudy whapped her tail slowly, lost in thought, her gaze to the ground. She took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, then looked up at Sniper. “Sniper, I-I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have judged you for being mean to Wylanda. I’m guilty for being mean to her as well. Please forgive me.”
Sniper chewed his lower lip and looked at the slide, the swing, the tree house, and finally Cloudy. “Apology accepted. I forgive you,” he said softly.
Cloudy looked to the knight to see if he had any comment on this, but the realized he was gone. She blinked in surprise and quickly looked this way and that, but didn’t see him anywhere. “Miss Scazzarda?” she shouted.
“What is it, dear?”
“Where’s Magnus? He’s not here!”
“Hmm?” Scazzarda stood up and shaded her eyes from the glaring sun, looking around for her son. When she couldn’t spot him, she shrugged and sat back down in her shady spot underneath the tree house. “Oh, he probably went off by himself for a while. He does that a lot. Don’t worry about him.”
“Why does he go off by himself?” Star wondering, gazing wonderingly at Scazzarda.
“When he wants to be alone or to think.”
“What does he want to think about?” Sniper asked with a slight smirk. It was obvious he was being more than a little nosy.
Scazzarda’s tranquil expression changed to one of uneasiness and wariness. “Well, I can’t say.”
“Why not?” Arrow asked.
“You’re not old enough to understand,” was the reply.
Arrow decided not to say anything more. So did Cloudy. Both decided to trust Scazzarda’s judgment; after all, she was older and wiser. The other children looked curiously at one another, their eyes bright and puzzled, but did not speak.
“Oh, oh,” Miriam said, noticing her mother standing at the edge of the crowd and waving to her. “Looks like Mom wants me. BRB.” And like a shot, she was off and running.
“BRB?” Cloudy repeated.
“Be right back,” Scazzarda murmured sleepily, her eyes drifting closed.
“Oh.” Cloudy fell silent, watching Miriam tear through the throng as fast as she could.

                                                     *   *   *   *   *

“What?!” Miriam stared wild-eyed at her mother, her face full of shock and disbelief. “We have to leave the feast?! Why?!!”
“I don’t want to stay here anymore,” Meredith said shortly. “I’m tired and dizzy and I feel sick. I just wanted to go home.”
Miriam caught her mother’s hand and pressed it gently to her chest. “Mom, you’re stressing yourself out too much. You need to relax.”
“Relax!” Meredith spat the word as if she had heard something unpleasant. “How can I relax if my husband is weak and injured and we’re about to be homeless?!”
Miriam was surprised beyond measure. If her mother had ever showed any lack of faith, it was now. Putting her hands on her hips and speaking sharply, Miriam retorted, “Mom, what happened to trusting God to provide for our needs?”
“Provide.” Meredith whispered the word as though it were foreign to her. “Provide?” Her eyes glazed over and she grabbed the top fence rail.
“Mom?” Miriam said, fear beginning to bubble up in her at her mother’s strange look. “Are you all right?”
“I’m. . .fine. . .” Suddenly Meredith swayed and almost fell, but Miriam caught her arm and stopped her from toppling to the ground.
“Meredith!” Springtime yelled, running toward her with Showerstorm in tow. “Are you okay?”
Meredith turned toward Springtime, her eyes devoid of any light. “No.” She sounded as if she would cry.
“Mom!”
“Meredith!”
“Here, I’ve got her,” Showerstorm said, supporting Meredith as he led her to the house to lie down. Springtime watched them go, then turned to Miriam. “Your mother will be okay, honey,” she said soothingly.
Miriam’s face was filled with worry and her eyes with tears. Her chin trembled as she whispered, “is Mom sick? Is something wrong with her?”
Springtime knelt down so that she was on eye level with the little girl. “Has your mother had these symptoms for a while?”
Miriam nodded. “Yeah, for about three weeks or so.”
“Has she vomited in the morning at all?”
Miriam nodded again, looking confused. “Why do you ask?”
Springtime grinned widely as she stood up and headed for the house. “If I’m not mistaken, Miriam,” she said over her shoulder, “you might be having a little brother or sister soon!”
Miriam stared at Springtime’s retreating back, amazed. A little brother or sister?! Did that mean a baby?!! Miriam was so happy she smiled, her heart full of gladness. She wanted to dance, jump, laugh, whoop with joy, shout the good news to everyone—but she didn’t.
“I must run to tell my friends,” she said to herself. “They’ll be amazed.” With these thoughts in mind, she sprinted excitedly in the direction of the tree house, pausing only when someone got in her way. Politely she asked them to move and was off again.
Miriam was almost to the tree house when someone stepped in front of her again. With a resigned sigh, she was about to ask the person to please move aside when she saw who it was. Her breath caught in her throat and her dark eyes grew wide.
It was Wylanda!
For a moment, the two stared each other down. Then Wylanda spoke, “Where are you going, little beggar girl?”
Miriam found herself blushing as she glanced at her worn brown dress. She was furious, about to bite back with a lashing retort, but then recalled what Scazzarda had said about treating Wylanda with kindness. “Um, hi, Wylanda,” she said, mustering up her friendliest voice. “I was just going to see my friends.”
“Why?” Wylanda sneered. “Do you have some exciting piece of news that you’re just dying to share with them?”
Miriam nodded, her face lighting up with joy. Wylanda noticed her change of expression. “As a matter of fact, I do have some exciting news, Wylanda.”
An interested expression came over Wylanda’s face. “What?” she asked, her voice full of curiosity.
“My mom’s having a baby!” Miriam announced.
Wylanda’s mouth flew wide open in shock. “What??”
“I know! I know! It’s exciting, isn’t it?” Miriam danced about happily. “I’ve always wanted a sibling and now I’ll have one! Yay! Praise God!”
Wylanda narrowed her eyes at the mention of God. “Why would God give you a sibling?” she asked in a surly tone.
Miriam’s face flushed red with anger at the rude question, but she decided to be gracious. Pasting a smile on her face, she answered,” Because God loves me!”
“God loves you?” Wylanda sounded genuinely confused. “Why would He love you?”
“Because I’m His daughter and He’s my Father.” Then Miriam stopped dancing and looked solemnly at Wylanda, and with a gentle voice said, “You could be His daughter too, Wylanda, if you would ask Him to take you in.”
Wylanda threw up her hands and rolled her eyes to the heavens. “Miriam, my own father wasn’t even reliable. Why would I ask some strange Galilean carpenter Who lived two thousand years ago to be my Father?”
Miriam frowned, pondering Wylanda’s words. “Wait. Did you just say your own dad wasn’t reliable?”
Wylanda’s eyes widened and she put her hand over her mouth, realizing she had just slipped up. “Um, never mind. That was never meant to be revealed to anyone. . .”
Miriam’s eyes filled with compassion. “Oh, Wylanda. You were adopted, weren’t you?”
Wylanda didn’t answer.
“Your biological parents probably did something to you and you were taken from them and sent to an orphanage. Is that right?”
There was silence. Then Wylanda answered faintly, “I never wanted anyone to know.”
“Why didn’t you tell us you were adopted?”
“Because you all come from good homes and I don’t want to be noted as the outcast,” Wylanda snapped. “Okay? My parents left me on the sidewalk when I was born because they didn’t want a girl, for goodness’ sake! My neighbor took me to the orphanage and two years later, I was adopted by Mother and Father Coven. They’ve taken care of me ever since.”
Miriam felt sorry for Wylanda for the first time. “Unfortunately, you’re not alone in that situation. Most kids are adopted, Wylanda.”
Wylanda’s face was taut with bitterness. “If God really loved me, I don’t think He would allow me to go through such a thing as that, would He? Am I some kind of stranger to Him because I was adopted?”
Miriam shook her head. “No. No one is a stranger to God, Wylanda. He made everyone and everything; He knows all their names. He created the sun, moon, stars, planets, galaxies, animals, and everything else you could think of! But He didn’t just create the universe and then sit back to let it run on its own. No, He cared for His creation. He still is caring for it, in fact, and will until the end of the age. Wylanda, God is the most trustworthy Person in existence.”
“I thought God died,” Wylanda said. “He died on the cross many years ago.”
Miriam stoutly nodded her head. “Oh, He died, all right. He died for you and me. He took everyone’s sins on His shoulders and drank every drop of His Father’s wrath so we wouldn’t have to. But He’s not dead anymore,” she proclaimed. “He rose from the grave three days after He was crucified and conquered death and sin!” Her eyes bright, she asked, “Do you believe that, Wylanda?”
Wyladan raised an eyebrow and tapped her forehead thoughtfully, carefully thinking of her words. “I mean. . .yeah, I believe in God. I believe He’s real and He’s divine and that He died on the cross and that He’s three people in one—Father, Son, and Spirit.” She hesitated a moment, as if uncertain of something.
Miriam prodded, “So what do you not believe?”
Wylanda acted a bit startled by the question, but answered, “Well, I don’t believe that God loves everyone like some Christians say he does. I mean, like, what about those with bad backgrounds and incredibly evil pasts? Why in the world would God want anything to do with them? I also do not believe He rose from the dead. If He really is alive, he should be caring for and protecting His creation, and from what I’ve seen, that’s not the case. There’s so much evil in the world and hardly any good, you know. If I were God, I wouldn’t allow anything terrible to happen.”
Miriam nodded, though she was slightly puzzled by Wylanda’s views of the world. “Can you explain why you believe what you do?”
Wylanda scratched her head and looked at her freshly painted fingernails. “Um. . .well, I mean, from what my old public school teachers taught me, the Bible is not a Book to be taken literally. You have to use your brain and decide which parts are reliable and which parts that weren’t mean to be taken literally. . .” He voice trailed off as she noticed Miriam staring at her.
“But Wylanda,” Miriam insisted, spreading out her hands, “if you don’t believe certain parts of the Bible, why believe any part of it?”
Wylanda didn’t know how to answer. “Are you trying to be smart with me?” she angrily demanded.
“No,” Miriam said, shaking her head. “I’m trying to get you to think.” She took a deep breath and rushed on. “You see, Wylanda, the Bible lines up with history and the world today perfectly. Everything is in line with what the Bible says. Prophecies from the Bible have been and are being fulfilled even today.”
“Maybe so, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to believe everything the Bible says,” Wylanda muttered. “Not unless you can prove to me it’s trustworthy.”
Miriam frowned, but pressed on. “Okay, think of this: If one part of the Bible isn’t trustworthy, should any part be trusted?”
Wylanda just looked at her.
“Or think of this: Why would you believe in something that’s not fully trustworthy?”
Wylanda still didn’t reply. She couldn’t answer the young girl’s questions adequately. “I don’t know,” she said finally, “and I don’t care. The point is, I really don’t want anything to do with all that religion. It’s a waste of time.”
Miriam crossed her arms and got right up in Wylanda’s face, causing her to back away a few steps. “Wylanda, I will say this: Christianity is not a religion. Christianity is trusting in God for salvation and asking Him to be your Lord and Savior. Once that happens, He now governs your life. Now religion—that is working your way to salvation through good works.”
Wylanda blinked, nonplussed for a minute, but she snapped back, “Still, I don’t want to answer to Jesus for everything I ever do. If I’m not saved, I don’t have to go to Him all the time and repent of my wrongdoings, nor do I have to bother with being sure to spend time with Him. I’d rather not do that.”
“Everyone’s going to answer to Jesus one day whether they want to or not,” Miriam retorted. “If you’re saved, you go to heaven. If not, you go to hell. It’s as simple as that. And I don’t care what anyone else thinks—God knows each individual person’s heart and knows whether they are saved or not. Don’t think anyone can run from God, because they can’t. Everyone will either go to one of two places—heaven or hell. Your choice.”
Wylanda’s eyes grew wide as she witnessed Miriam—three years younger than herself—boldly proclaiming the truth to her. For some unknown reason, that made Wylanda feel very small and cowardly, but she couldn’t tell why.
\Wylanda opened her mouth, about to speak, but then shut it her and said quietly, “Okay, then. I get that.” She brushed a grasshopper off her dress and straightened a lock of her hair, then looked at the ground. “Um, please tell me, Miriam, how God can want anything to do with evil people.”
Miriam studied the girl, wondering if she truly wanted to know or was just looking for an excuse to mock her. But there was nothing mocking or sarcastic in Wylanda’s looks.
“Everyone is evil, Wylanda,” Miriam explained. “We’re all born sinners. There’s no pick-and-choose method when it comes to who’s evil and who’s not. Romans 3:23 says, ‘For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.’ All sin and deserve to go to hell.” She sighed heavily and sadly shook her head. “It all goes back to the Garden of Eden. The world was originally a perfect place, where men and God could talk and be together in perfect harmony. But when Eve ate of the fruit from the tree which Go forbade her to eat from, the fellowship between God and man was broken. God hates sin and can’t look upon it.”
“The why didn’t God stop Eve from disobeying?” Wylanda asked.
Miriam shrugged. “He could have, but then Eve would have been a robot, forced to do what God wanted her to.”
“But I thought God wanted us to do right.”
“He does, but He won’t force us to do so,” Miriam said. “He gives us a choice to do what’s right or wrong. And as Christians, we should want to please God and strive to be like Him. That’s not to say we won’t ever mess up, okay, because we will. We’re not perfect. We still have a sin nature. But God is merciful and will forgive us if we go to Him and repent.”
Miriam felt a thrill run through her. She was actually ministering to someone about God! This was possibly the best thing to happen to her next to her conversion.
“Okay, I get it,” Wylanda said softly. “But what about those with awful backgrounds, like mine?”
“God loves those kinds of people too!” The smallest smile worked its way across Miriam’s face. “But even though there are those who have been brutally abused or have messed up, God doesn’t care. He cares nothing about the past, creed, or ethnicity of someone. All He wants is for all to come to Him and be His children.”
Wylanda nodded understandingly. “I get that.” Then she frowned. “But, um, I have another question.”
“Uh-huh?”
“ Why does God have to send us to hell for committing some small sins, such as lying or stealing something? Our sins are small compared to eternity, so why does He judge us so harshly? I mean, I don’t really think the punishment fits the crime.”
Miriam looked off in the distance and chewed her lip, trying to think of a way to explain the answer to Wylanda. “Okay.” She faced Wylanda again. “Think of this scenario: Suppose a heartless murderer took only one minute to strangle a young child, okay?” Seeing Wylanda’s disgusted expression, she hastened to add, “Sorry if this sounds graphic, but bear with me. Suppose it took only a minute to kill this young girl. Now here’s the question: Would you put him in prison for the same amount of time it took to commit the crime?”
Wylanda shook her head. “No.”
“That’s right. Now picture this: Say this same murderer kills the king of Dreamland, and it takes only thirty seconds. Would you put him in prison for that same length of time in which he was able to murder the king?”
Again Wylanda said no.
“But why not?” Miriam inquired innocently.
“Because that’s not serving justice!” Wylanda protested. “A murderer who kills a king deserves to be put in prison for life, not a few seconds! Justice needs to be served, and the only way to obtain justice is for the murderer to serve a punishment proportionate to the crime he committed.”
“That’s correct,” Miriam said. “Time in prison for assaulting someone depends on the status of the person, right? And killing the king would definitely be at the top of the list.”
“But what does this have to do with my question?”
“God is the Ruler of Creation. He is majestic, wonderful, and awesome. He is above every earthly king or emperor. And sinning against Him requires a very heavy price to pay, which is death. We deserve to die, both physically and spiritually. Therefore, Wylanda, God is indeed giving us a just punishment.”
Wylanda folded her arms. “Who taught you all of this, Miriam?”
“My mother!” Miriam sang.
Wylanda looked surprised, then confused, and last of all troubled, but said nothing. She just glanced at Miriam and then walked off without another word. Miriam watched her go, wondering what was going on in that mind of hers. Then the seven-year-old took to her heels and ran off toward the tree house.
 
                                                  *   *   *   *   *

“Guys! Hey, guys!” Cloudy was roused by Miriam’s excited voice and opened her eyes. She had been taking a lovely nap next to Scazzarda in the shade. Now she stretched, got up, and ambled her way over to her friends.
“Oh, Miriam!” Arrow called, waving a paw. “Hi! What did your mom want you for?”
Miriam was practically wriggling with excitement as she plopped down next to Star. She leaned forward, her eyes bright with joy as she said in a stage whisper, “My mom’s having a baby!”
“What!” the children chorused.
“It’s true! My mom’s pregnant!”
“Congratulations,” came a Spanish-accented voice from the top of a nearby tree. Startled, Miriam looked up and saw the knight standing there, his cape drawn about himself. “Having a baby is always exciting. My daughter is having one nerself.”
“You have a daughter?” asked Cloudy. “I didn’t know that.”
“Yes, I do.” Miriam thought the knight’s voice seemed a little sad as he said the words, and she wondered why. However, she was too afraid to ask.
Arrow cleared his throat loudly, causing everyone to turn to toward him. H too had sensed the knight’s unhappy mood and wanted to change the subject. “I, for one, absolutely can’t wait for the feast tonight,” he said. “Miss Springtime says we get to stand up and say what we’re thankful for.”
“And I suppose you’re thankful for this bunch of losers,” came an all-too-familiar voice from behind Star. Arrow gasped softly and the knight visibly tensed. Miriam slowly turned her head and saw Wylanda standing there, her brown eyes dark and intimidating.
“Uhhhh. . .” Miriam was a loss for words.
“What do you want?” Sharkell asked coolly. “We’re trying to have a private conversation here.”
“It won’t be so private once you say it at the dinner table tonight.” Wylanda laughed as if she had just heard the funniest joke on the planet. “You’re talking about what you’re thankful for, aren’t you?”
That was Miriam’s chance. “Yes, Wylanda. Why don’t you join us?”
“What?!” Lily roared. “She’s a brat!”
“No way is she sitting with us! She insulted us and called us losers!” Nika chimed in.
“Okay, that is quite. . .” Scazzarda began, but Wylanda cut her off.
“Oh, be quiet, old grandma.” Back to the children. “I wouldn’t join you guys for the world. Besides, why would I? I don’t have anything to be thankful for.”
“Huh?” Cloudy blinked a few times, completely astounded. “But of course you do!”
“Yeah? Like what?” Wylanda smirked. “Tell me, Prophesied One!”
Cloudy’s mind was spinning with all sorts of things Wylanda could be thankful for. “Well, for one, what about your big mansion and your jewels and your fancy dresses?”
Wylanda suddenly acted very uncomfortable. “I. . .No, I-I don’t. . .”
“What’s the matter, Wylanda? Cat got your tongue?” Sniper asked, a hint of a smirk on his lips.
Wylanda bit her lip. “I. . .I meant that those things don’t make me happy,” she rushed to explain.
“I’m not in the least bit surprised,” Eloise muttered under her breath. “If you don’t have God, you’re not gonna be happy with anything.”
“What about your parents?” Cloudy queried. “Aren’t you grateful for them?”
Wylanda answered defiantly, “No, I’m not grateful for them. They’re so fussy and overprotective of me and won’t let me go anywhere without an adult except for school. They’re stupid, religious, holier-than-thou Christians who make me read my Bible and pray with them every day. Every day, they tell me I need to accept Jesus as my personal Lord and Savior. I’m sick of it.”
That surprised Cloudy in more ways than one. She had no idea that Wylanda’s parents were Christians.
But Scazzarda was horrified. “Why, Wylanda Coven!” she exclaimed. “How can you say such awful things about your parents? They love you and try so hard to raise you right.”
“What do I care?” Wylanda shot back. “They can love me, but I don’t love them.”
The children were speechless. The knight, feeling anger and sorrow rising in him, suppressed it with all his strength. But Eloise was thoroughly fed up with Wylanda’s verbal abuse. She stood up and shrieked loudly at Wylanda, causing her to recoil. “I’ve had it with you, Wylanda Coven! I will not put up your insults and complaints any longer! You have no clue what it means to love, you spoiled, rotten girl! You’re a huge loser! You make fun of everyone and laugh at others that are less fortunate than you! You make them feel unappreciated and unloved! Well, guess what? If you show hate to others, I’m going to show hate right back to you!”
“Eloise!” Nika cried. “Eloise, what about the Golden R—”
“No!” Eloise yelled at her little sister. She was so enraged she was shaking. “I don’t give a lick about the Golden Rule anymore! If Wylanda wants to spread hate around, I’ll shove it right back in her face!” Turning back to Wylanda, she continued, “You’ve made others feel miserable for far too long, Wylanda! Now I’m gonna make you feel a million times worse! You’re stupid, you’re ugly, you’re an idiot, and I can’t stand being around you! I’m surprised anyone could! You wanna know my honest opinion on you? Well, too bad if you don’t, because here it is: You don’t deserve any love! You. . .are. . . hated!”
“Eloise!” Cloudy screamed at the top of her lungs. “Stop it right now!!”
Eloise stopped yelling and looked at her friend, who was staring at her as if she were a crazy person who had escaped a mental institution. Suddenly realizing what she had done, Eloise gasped and sank to the ground, guilt flooding her through. What had she done? Why had she said such terrible things?
The entire crowd had heard the heated speech and were staring, shocked, at Eloise and Wylanda. Even Mrs. Coven was there, her gaze disapproving as she glared at Eloise with contempt. There was no sound but the whooshing of the wind and the rustle of leaves. 
Eloise and Wylanda looked at each other for the longest time, but neither one spoke. Wylanda’s look as one of fright and hurt as she stared with wild eyes at the other girl. Eloise knew she had upset Wylanda with her unkind words and neede to apologize for that. She stood up and said softly, “Um, Wylanda, I. . .”
“No!” Wylanda exclaimed, backing away. Her eyes were full of terror. “Don’t-Don’t you dare come near me!”
“But I want to. . .”
“Get away from me!” With those words, Wylanda took off for the house and disappeared among the crowd. Oddly, Mrs. Coven did not try to stop her.
Cloudy, her eyes narrowed, knew that the time had come to have a calm, serious talk with Wylanda. The longer this unrest went on, the worse things would get with her. With these thoughts in her head, Cloudy started off toward the house.
“Cloudy, where are you going?” Arrow called as she started to walk off. 
“To talk to Wylanda,” Cloudy replied without turning around.
“What? Are you joking?” Star asked. “That girl hates you! She wouldn’t listen to you for anything!”
“Well, I’m going to try,” Cloudy said firmly, a determined glint in her eye. “Lord knows what Wylanda’s going through. I believe He’s calling me to talk to her.”
